1,Justin,Yarrell,,jyarrell3@gatech.edu,Evening MBA,Master's,"Automotive Recycling, Innovation, and Sustainability","The Automotive Recycling Industry is currently ranked 16th largest in the United States, contributing more than $25 Billion (USD) to our Growth Domestic Product (GDP) annually through its collective recycling of: 15.5 million tons of steel, 85 million barrels of oil, as well as countless tons of small automotive cores and fluids. These recycling efforts support a global circular economy which is only growing more dependent upon the ferrous and non-ferrous metals that come from automotive salvage yards to meet the burgeoning demand for vehicles in the developing world. My name is Justin Yarrell, a second-year evening MBA student and former General Manager of a high-volume, automotive recycling yard in Atlanta, Georgia.  The focus of my research has been towards innovating several industry processes aimed at improving current inventory management and production processes, as well as implementing a more targeted, scalable vehicle procurement strategy. These innovations, based upon the integration of data analytics, automation, and an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Ecosystem, will not only create a Unique Value Proposition for local market consumers by increasing inventory service levels, but also will strive to make significant improvements to existing sustainability practices across the industry. Thus, it is my intent to demonstrate the value of these innovations, not simply from an economic value creation standpoint, but also how these would positively influence environmental sustainability."
2,Caglar,Caglayan,,ccaglayan6@gatech.edu,Industrial Engineering - Operations Research,Ph.D.,Physician Staffing in Emergency Department via a Multi-class Multi-Stage Network: Opening the Blackbox,"The Emergency Department (ED) is a highly complex care delivery system with time-varying unscheduled arrivals, medium-to-long service times, multiple treatment stages and multiple patient classes. Managing such a complex service system is a challenge and appropriate staffing lies at the heart of this challenge. In this paper, we study a physician staffing problem in the ED with time-varying stochastic arrivals. Our objective is to determine the optimal staffing levels for ED physicians, coupled with practical patient routing rules, that cope with time-varying demand in a timely manner and satisfy safety-related and patient-class specific service goals. We develop an ``intuitive"", ``realistic"" and ``tractable"" model of ED that is composed of a multi-class multi-stage queuing network with time-varying arrivals and multiple targeted service goals. Utilizing infinite-server approximation, we first approximate the expected physical and cognitive workload on physicians at each treatment stage in the ED. Then, by using a new staffing formula we developed, we convert the expected loads into staffing decisions that satisfy the targeted goals for each patient class. We prove that the new staffing rule asymptotically satisfies the desired convergence for stationary efficiency-driven queue regimes with no abandonment under the performance metric tail probability of delay. We numerically test the performance of this staffing algorithm in time-varying environments with sinusoidal arrival functions on a variety of network setups using a realistic ED simulation model. Finally, we apply the proposed staffing method, coupled with practical routing policies, to real patient flow-related timestamp data from Mayo Clinic for numerical analysis."

Passive adjustment in current practice is low efficient, non-optimal and experience-dependent. We propose an automated optimal shape control system that can adjust composite parts to an optimal configuration efficiently. It is accomplished by (i) building and validating an FEA platform; (ii) developing a surrogate model considering various uncertainties to achieve very good predictive performance; (iii) conducting a feed-forward control to determine the optimal actions. We show the system can significantly reduce assembly time and dramatically improve dimensional quality."
5,Alexander,Limia,,alimia3@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Thermal modeling of a dual-stage sodium thermal electrochemical converter,"The sodium thermal electrochemical converter (Na-TEC) is a heat engine that generates electricity through the isothermal expansion of sodium ions. By separating the conversion process into two stages, the thermodynamic efficiency can be improved through the reduction of bypass heat transfer from the evaporator to the condenser. Reduced-order thermal modeling is used to estimate the operating conditions and guide the design of the system. An axisymmetric geometry with a radiation symmetry plane is developed for the computational domain, with the overall size constrained by the largest commercially available ceramic for the electrolyte. It is shown that the largest internal thermal resistance must occur between the second conversion stage and the condenser. This is accomplished by corrugating the condenser walls to increase the heat diffusion path. Radiation heat transfer is simplified by the use of linear radiation shield networks and control emissivities. Conduction along the sodium filled liquid return path is calculated by neglecting advection (Pe < 5) and assuming negligible radiation (return path adjacent to the walls). Natural convection within the interior domain to the sodium vapor is neglected in this work. This reduced-order model can be used to reliably predict the system performance ("
6,Guanghui,Zhu,,gzhu36@gatech.edu,Chemical Engineering,Ph.D.,Membranes with porous organic cages for molecular separations,"Porous organic cages (POCs) are individual molecules that are porous and soluble. Compared to their extended framework counterparts, such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), POCs offer the advantage of solution processability. Moreover, when fabricated into mixed matrix membranes, the soluble POC molecules have the potential to exhibit molecular-level intimate mixing with polymer matrix. The incorporation of POCs into mixed matrix membrane is still in its infancy and lacks demonstration of comprehensive improvement of membrane performance. In this work, we utilized vertex functionalized amorphous scrambled porous organic cages (ASPOCs) in mixed matrix membranes to study a series of key questions in this field. The dispersion of ASPOCs possessing different crystallization tendencies within a polymer matrix are probed using Raman imaging and Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) mapping. Gas permeation experiments of N2, CO2, CH4 and SF6 were carried out as a function of ASPOC loading and crystallization tendency. A 4-8 fold of permeability increase was observed for N2, CO2 and CH4 compared to pure polymer membrane. Moreover, a clear molecular sieving effect was observed for SF6, resulting in 2-4 fold of increase of N2/SF6 selectivity compared to the pure polymer membrane. The membranes were further examined in organic solvent nanofiltration experiments using a cross-flow permeation approach. The Molecular Weight Cut Off (MWCO) of the membranes were calculated based on the polystyrene permeation tests. Overall, these membranes demonstrated homogeneous mixing between the POC molecules and the polymer matrix, and showed potential to be used in molecular separation processes."
7,Bailey,Risteen,,bristeen3@gatech.edu,Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,Ph.D.,Thermoresponsive Liquid Crystal Templating of Semiconducting Polymers,"One main challenge in producing flexible organic electronic devices is ensuring adequate performance of the active semiconducting polymer; the alignment of these polymers by intra- and interchain stacking is crucial to achieving superior optoelectronic properties and a high charge-carrier mobility. In this work, the liquid crystal ordering of bio-derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) was investigated as a means of enforcing long-range order in the semiconducting polymer poly[3-(potassium-4-butanoate) thiophene-2,5-diyl], PPBT. It was found that the inclusion of these renewable particles in PPBT solutions resulted in enhanced polymer chain alignment as confirmed by UV-Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Furthermore, when the CNCs were decorated with a thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), the liquid crystal phase, and therefore the semiconducting polymer ordering, could be switched by changing the temperature."
8,Michel,Lacerda,,michel.usp@gmail.com,Aerospace Engineering,Ph.D.,Early Conceptual Study on a Mars Exploration System with an Unmanned Aerial Autonomous Systems and a Ground Rover,"Exploration of Mars has been one of the focus of the aerospace community for its similarity with the Earth. The characteristics of Mars make possible an aerial flight even with the low pressure in its atmosphere. In an age where the ground rover exploration is dominant, the addition of a rotary-wing unmanned autonomous vehicle (UAV) would expand the exploration possibilities, increasing the range and the amount of scientific data collected. In this work, it is shown a conceptual systems design that combines a rotary-wing UAV and a ground rover in collaboration, for the exploration of the terrain. The work is being developed at the Systems Engineering level of conceptualization and Design phase.The goal of this study is to develop a conceptual design for a collaborative system for Mars exploration based on a ground rover and an aerial UAV. The collaborative exploration would have the ground-rover, the UAV, and augmented reality systems enabling Ground control on Earth or future Astronauts on site to interact in the exploration as well. The motivation for using an UAV for the exploration of Mars are the recent progress in autonomous systems, rotorcraft technology, and battery capacity. In addition, the aerial exploration has benefits: path free of obstacles, avoidance of adverse conditions, a larger radius of exploration, the possibility of sampling of any terrain. For the aerospace, and in special, for the rotorcraft community, it would be the first winged (rotor) aerial flight in an extraterrestrial atmosphere, as challenging as it can be."
9,Vedant,Mehta,,vmehta31@gatech.edu,Nuclear Engineering,Master's,Tackling Global Issues with Nuclear Technology,"Nuclear energy has a high energy density and low carbon dioxide emissions, which makes it so attractive compared to other energy sources.  The current fleet of nuclear reactors heavily rely mostly on Light Water Reactor Technology that produce 2.5 million GWh worldwide. Although, this is a very mature technology, there are some aspects, such as relatively low efficiency (33%), that may be further improved. The current technology aims to develop high-temperature advanced designs that improves the efficiency considerably (45%) and extends the application range of the nuclear technology, e.g. sea water distillation. An example of such design is based on a recent high-temperature reactor developed by Oak Ridge national lab. The design includes many innovative features, such as passive safety and accident tolerant fuel. The main issue of this concept is associated with the high costs of the proposed fuel (i.e. 10-100 times higher to the typical UO2 fuel). My project focuses on extending the residence time of the fuel in the reactor and hence leads to fuel cycle costs reduction. The proposed operation regime provides cost savings up to $15 million per year per reactor. Additional benefits of the proposed design include nuclear waste reduction and flexible reactor control. All these significantly promotes this technology to commercial deployment."
10,,Nguyen,,lnguyen91@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,"Backscattering Side-Channels: Characteristics, Modeling, and Comparison With Other Side-Channels","This paper introduces a new backscattering sidechannel that is a consequence of impedance changes in switching circuits and is referred to as an impedance-based side-channel. First, it was discussed how this side-channel is created by switching activity of transistors in microprocessors. It was demonstrated that the variation between high-state and low-state of transistors gates changes the radar cross section (RCS) of the processor which results in a modulated reflected signal that can be observed several meters away from the device. To better understand the backscatter channel created by electronic activity, a transistor-level impedance model and backscatter power model are also developed and tested against the measurements. Then, the spectral content of impedance side-channel is compared with those of power and EM side-channel and the differences are discussed. Finally, it was demonstrated that all three sidechannels can be used for malware detection in embedded devices."
11,Saswat,Mishra,,smishra95@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Electrooculogram classification for eye therapy and machine interface enabled by stretchable and flexible electronics,"An upsurge of wearable devices has initiated the profound sensing technology of skin electrodes used for eye therapy and human-machine interfacing. A thin metallic membrane is printed directly onto a soft silicone elastomer through an additive manufacturing process. Fine features of 5 micron width are printed with a stretchable (>150% ) and flexible(~180Â°) geometry.  The skin-electrode is transferred onto the outer canthi of the head for electrooculogram signals for ocular measurements. Quantitative analysis of convergence insufficiency therapy is inadequate in today's optometrist offices. Even more problematic, there is no sufficient therapy for at home procedures, so we designed a virtual reality therapy. Skin-electrodes are capable of measuring eye vergence motions of ~ 1Â° while replacing expensive high speed cameras. Additionally, the extracted signals are inserted into a machine learning classification interface that assesses the quality of eye vergence motions. Eye therapy is only half the potential; these skin-electrodes are integrated with a SKINTRONIC bluetooth data acquisition unit that ergonomically adheres to the skin. The dual integration of a soft sensor and data acquisition device processes signals through an android program to control a wheelchair with eye movements. Classification accuracy of eye movements for the control of a wheelchair are > 94% in real time."
12,Jennifer,Rattray,,jrattray3@gatech.edu,Biology - Sciences,Ph.D.,What's the Quorum? Density sensing and cellular heterogeneity in Pseudomonas aeuriginosa,"Despite their microscopic size, bacteria have large impacts on our daily life from carbon and nitrogen cycling to infections and biofouling. Biofilm formation, virulence factor production, and bioluminescence are all examples of collective behaviors bacteria exhibit to impact the environment around them on a multi-microbe scale. The study of bacterial communication, termed quorum sensing (QS), has uncovered a highly coordinated mechanism of monitoring and producing signaling molecules, a simple system of decision making. This project focuses on both group and individual response to increasing population densities in an isogenic, homogenous environment in order to build upon the strong molecular work currently available. For this study, I utilized a lab strain of the opportunist pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa containing a transcription fusion of the QS regulated elastase promoter with a green fluorescent protein (GFP). This allowed for visualization of a passive non-fluorescent QS OFF state and an active green fluorescent QS ON state. While canonical work refers to quorum sensing as a threshold-like behavior with coordinated response, my work has discovered a high level of heterogeneity in response to increasing density. Cells were analyzed in bulk via microplate assays to understand population level response as well as via high powered microscopy to understand cellular response. By using a combination of molecular biology and by applying classic concepts in ecology and evolution, I plan on teasing apart this heterogeneity to understand how and speculate why a system that exists to coordinate behavior exhibits so much variation."
13,Hanyan,Li,,hli378@gatech.edu,Civil Engineering,Ph.D.,"ASSESSING THE TIME, MONETARY, AND ENERGY COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE MODES","One of the most popular strategies for reducing energy use and emissions in the transportation sector is to provide public transit systems designed to help shift commute mode choice from single-occupant vehicles to shared use transit vehicles.  When transit ridership is high, energy use per commuter- trip is low.  Promoting such mode shifts necessitates a clear understanding of the factors that influence mode choice, which is the basis for incorporation of choice modeling into travel demand models.  However, the data used in transit choice modeling typically come from small studies, and it is difficult to accurately quantify the actual tradeoffs across different travel modes.  This study develops a platform in Python to assess travel time, energy use, and monetary cost of various commute alternatives including automobile, local transit rail and bus, express bus, and park and ride.  The platform consists of three modules:  the routing module generates a best-available routing path per commute alternative; the energy module calculates energy use based on the MOVES-Matrix and the Fuel and Emissions Calculator, with real-world operations data applied; the cost module estimates the transit and driving cost.  In the case study, 2,400 commute trips in Atlanta, Georgia are processed through the platform.  The results show that transit availability can be significantly increased through park and ride without sacrificing fuel-saving benefits.  However, travel time and cost are increased in most transit trips, and only two of the 2,400 local transit-park and ride trips yielded a reduction in all three parameters of travel time, energy use, and cost.  This platform can be easily customized and applied to other areas."
15,Sanam,Gorgan Nejad,,sgorgan@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Characterization and prediction of the aged state of Ni-based superalloy employing data science,"The microstructure of the Ni-based superalloys used in the hot section of the gas turbines has shown to continuously evolve and degrade under the operating conditions which ultimately deteriorate the properties of the component. This paper demonstrates the implementation of the data analytics algorithms to the Ni-based superalloy structural data to develop models by which prediction and estimation of the state of the microstructure is accomplished. High-throughput aging experiments were performed to systematically introduce aged microstructure and a dataset comprising of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs was generated. The 2-point statistics, also known as 2-point spatial correlations were employed for microstructure quantification purpose. Model construction requires representation of the high dimensional structural information in a lower dimension space. In this work, we adopted two algorithms to reduce the dimensionality of the data and establishing the model. In the first attempt, principal component analysis (PCA) in conjunction with regression analysis produced a set of equations to estimate the PC scores of the resulting microstructure from the aging parameters (force, temperature and time). Later, we introduce the application of a novel and recently developed algorithm, so-called tensor regression (TR) that merges the dimensionality reduction and model construction step into a single one. The output of the TR model is directly the statistical descriptors of the microstructure rather than the PC scores, therefore declining the amount of information loss. The prediction accuracy of the two models was assessed by cross-validation and compared against each other.  Even though PCA provides an effective tool for visualization and classification of data, the model built based on TR algorithm showed to have stronger prediction capability."

17,Krysten,Minnici,,kminnici3@gatech.edu,Chemical Engineering,Ph.D.,Ion exchange of PPBT for use as a polymeric binder in Li-ion anodes,"Battery electrodes are complex mesoscale systems comprised of an active material, conductive agent, current collector, and polymeric binder. The majority of electrode material research for Li-ion batteries focuses on the synthesis of active particles, with less focus on polymeric binders. However, the binder plays a crucial role in stability and ensures electrode integrity during volume changes during cycling. The traditional polymeric binder, poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF), fails to accommodate large changes in spacing between particles during cycling. As such, it is believed the role of active material-binder interactions is essential for electrode stability. Recently, a poly[3-(potassium-4-butanoate)thiophene] (PPBT) binder component and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) surface coating for the active material was demonstrated to enhance both electron and ion transport in magnetite (Fe3O4) based anodes. It has been established that the PEG/PPBT system aids in overall battery performance, but little is known about the PPBT binder. 

To gain fundamental insight into PPBT and verify a counterion effect, the potassium ion is replaced through a facile ion exchange procedure with sodium, lithium, hydrogen and ammonium. XPS is used to verify the successful completion of the ion exchange procedure. Preliminary investigation has been done with the ion exchanged P-Na-BT. Electrodes were fabricated with PEG-Fe3O4, carbon additives and the new P-Na-BT polymeric binder and SEM was used to investigate morphological differences. The ion exchange with Na+ appears to have impacted particle agglomeration, where electrodes fabricated with PPBT appear less well-dispersed than the ion exchanged P-Na-BT. Preliminary electrochemical characterization reveals further differences between the polymeric binders."
18,Xiaodan,Xu,,arielinseu@gmail.com,Civil Engineering,Ph.D.,Regional Emission Analysis using Travel Demand Models and MOVES-Matrix,"Travel demand models (TDM) are developed by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) for analyzing regional travel patterns, and are often used to prepare activity inputs for use with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) for regional emissions inventory development, transportation air quality conformity analysis, and microscale air quality impact assessment.  Modelers are required to either prepare multiple MOVES runs for various scenarios, or develop their own MOVES pre-processors and post-processors for emission modeling.  Either approach is cumbersome and time-consuming.  To reduce modeling time and resource requirements, the team has developed a tool that automates the processing of TDM outputs and produces the same results as MOVES.  In this study, MOVES-Matrix emissions modeling processor was linked directly with TDM to develop emissions estimates at both the link and inventory levels.  MOVES-Matrix was developed by iteratively running the MOVES across all possible combinations of input variables to create a multi-dimensional emission rate lookup matrix and produce much faster outputs at runtime.  The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) TDM was used within metropolitan Atlanta area to demonstrate the performance of the automated tool.  For this purpose, inventory-level emission modeling was first conducted using MOVES, and these emission results were compared with results from the automated process.  Link-level emissions were similarly analyzed.  The results indicate that the tool produces emission results identical to the direct application of MOVES, while significantly reducing processing time.  The tool is beneficial for use in inventory development, conformity analysis, and microscale dispersion modeling."
19,Lei,Zhang,,lzhang337@gatech.edu,Materials Science and Engineering,Ph.D.,A tailored double perovskite nanofiber catalyst enables ultrafast oxygen evolution,"Rechargeable metal air batteries and water splitting are highly competitive options for a sustainable energy future, but their commercialization is hindered by the absence of cost-effective, highly efficient and stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. Here we report the rational design and synthesis of a double perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+d nanofiber as a highly efficient and robust catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Co-doping of strontium and iron into PrBaCo2O5 Ã¾ d is found to be very effective in enhancing intrinsic activity (normalized by the geometrical surface area, ~4.7 times), as validated by electrochemical measurements and first-principles calculations. Further, the nanofiber morphology enhances its mass activity remarkably (by ~20 times) as the diameter is reduced to ~20 nm, attributed to the increased surface area and an unexpected intrinsic activity enhancement due possibly to a favourable eg electron filling associated with partial surface reduction, as unravelled from chemical titration and electron energy-loss spectroscopy."
20,Wenqin,You,,wyou6@gatech.edu,Chemical Engineering,Ph.D.,"Competitive Binding of Ethylene, Water, and Carbon Monoxide in Metal-Organic Framework Materials with Open Cu Sites","Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with open metal sites (OMS) are known to have selectivity in olefin/paraffin separations. One challenge associated with these separations is that other species that may bind strongly to OMS may also be present in feed streams, causing competition for these sites. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to assess the binding energy of ethylene, water and carbon monoxide on a set of more than- 60 MOFs with open Cu sites in the form of Cu dimers. One useful observation from our results is that the relative binding energies of pairs of molecules (e.g. ethylene and water) can be calculated accurately from calculations that hold the MOF structure rigid and only relax the positions of the adsorbing molecules. These kinds of calculations are far more numerically efficient than calculations that relax all degrees of freedom in the system, so this observation will be useful in future efforts to screen larger collections of materials. A second observation is that the binding energies of each molecule in the 60 MOFs are quite similar to the binding energies in CuBTC, an exemplar MOF with open Cu sites in the form of Cu dimers. Analysis of the variations that do exist in the binding energies among materials points to possible avenues for controlling either the absolute binding energies or the relative binding energies of species associated with OMS in these materials."
21,Thomas,Kwok,,tkwok@gatech.edu,Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering,Ph.D.,Lignin Value Prior to Pulping,"Organic solvent treatments of biomass may facilitate the production of chemicals, fuels, nanocellulose, and pulp.  These treatments are characterized by their effects on the two main components of biomass: lignin and cellulose. This work leverages our understanding of the pulp and paper industry, the biggest consumer of lignin and cellulose. We describe a process that employs an organic solvent to remove lignin from biomass while maintaining cellulosic integrity for pulp production. This next-generation pulping system, called lignin value prior to pulping (LVPP), provides an un-sulfonated lignin stream and improves the operating economics of a pulp mill. Through a techno-economic analysis, we describe the LVPP implementation of organic solvents like alkylene carbonates and alcohols.  This analysis provides a minimum lignin-selling price (MLSP), and highlights the feasibility of an LVPP process."
22,Aline,Banboukian,,abanboukian3@gatech.edu,Public Policy,Master's,Effects of Financing Mechanisms on Electricity Development: Case Study Rwanda,"International and national sources of funding for electricity development in developing countries reflect donor priorities. These differ from assumptions in the optimization models used to plan national energy development. Moreover, actual project costs, lead-times and operational capacity differ from modeled assumptions. The project focuses on Rwanda as a case study. The study provides a retrospective analysis of the relationship of the funding resources, funding used, and outcomes with the optimization models and policies. Projects that have been proposed and implemented in Rwanda are examined in detail. The type, restrictions, and rules of the funds and their consequences on the projects are assessed. Emphasis is on circumstances in which different choices would be made if differential funding, financing, and outcomes were considered in advance. The preliminary results show that the investors play a big role in the projects' status by the terms and conditions that they subject the borrower to. The paper concludes that a project's status is also highly affected by the type of investment it receives. Furthermore, the study shows that the government of Rwanda is doing its best to enhance the development of the sector and attract investors of different types as best fits the sector. The outcome of the study could be used by planners of electricity development teams in East Africa and policymakers to consider the constraints and conditions given of funding sources as a component of electricity system production planning."
23,Revathi,Veriah,,rveriah3@gatech.edu,City and Regional Planning,Master's,"Classification of Informal Settlements Based on the Susceptibility to Climate Change: Ahmadabad, India","The Global Climate Risk Index (2016) ranks India in 10th place. The index analyses to what extent countries have been affected by the impact of extreme weather-related events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.) between 1995 and 2014. This predicts the country's vulnerability and susceptibility to the impacts of climate change in the future. Due to the concentration of population, urban areas are particularly vulnerable. Within cities, climate change will affect more the poor people who constitute between a quarter and half of Indian cites. The slum dwellers, squatters, migrants, people living in informal settlements, which are generally situated in vulnerable areas (river beds, flood plains, hill slopes), will be directly affected.
The four key climate stressors are (a) heat waves; (b) flooding and inundation; (c) water scarcity; and (d) increased climate change-related incidence of water and vector borne diseases.
This poster presents the analysis of 38 informal settlements in Ahmedabad, studied through the analysis of remote sensing data."
24,Aneeq,Zia,,aneeqzia@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Video and Accelerometer-Based Motion Analysis for Automated Surgical Skills Assessment,"Purpose: Basic surgical skills of suturing and knot tying are an essential
part of medical training. Having an automated system for surgical skills assessment
could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There have been some
recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using either video analysis
or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated
assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an analysis of different
features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer data).

Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for basic surgical
skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and accelerometer data for
suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce entropy based features Approximate
Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy (XApEn), which quantify
the amount of predictability and regularity of fluctuations in time-series data. The
proposed features are compared to existing methods of Sequential Motion Texture
(SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT),
for surgical skills assessment.

Results: We report average performance of different features across all applicable
OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows that the
proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art methods
using video and accelerometer data. 

Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be achieved with high accuracy
using the proposed entropy features. Such a system can significantly improve
the efficiency of surgical training in medical schools and teaching hospitals."
25,ARKADEEP,KUMAR,,arkadeepkumar@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Silicon-Diamond Interaction - Wear of Diamond by Multi-crystalline Silicon,"One of the hurdles of adoption of cleaner renewable solar energy is high cost of photovoltaics. Cost could be reduced by using cheaper multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers for solar cells, with gains in cost offsetting the reduction in efficiency. A critical challenge in slicing mc-Si wafers by the fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing process is increased wire consumption, compared to slicing the more expensive mono-crystalline silicon (mono-Si). To explain the challenges of higher wire consumption for mc-Si, we hypothesized that the material properties of mc-Si vs. mono-Si affect the wear of abrasives differently. We performed scribing experiments on mono and mc-Si blocks, with diamond tipped conical indenters of 120 Â° cone angle, representative of the actual diamond abrasives on fixed abrasive diamond wire. We observed scribing forces to be higher, and varying more, for mc-Si compared to mono-Si, with all other conditions being same. We investigated the wear of the diamond indenters using SEM, Raman microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), after same intervals of scribing distances. The characterization of diamond indenters shows wear progressed through physical fracture of the diamond surface. Some theories of nano-scale wear and chemical attrition are discussed for possible mechanisms of wear."
26,Ayesha,Khan,,ayeshakhan@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as Planners for Bio-inspired Robotic Motion,"In my research, we propose using Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) to serve as planners for bio-inspired robotic  motion. LSTMs  can  learn  long  or  short term  correlations of sequential data. Using LSTM networks, we implement a motion planner using simulated fish trajectories. The motion or  path  planning  unit  can  then  be  implemented  on  robots such  that  they  can  operate  autonomously  without  knowing their  absolute  position  in  a  global  frame.  Simulation  results
show  that  the  planned  path  demonstrates  characteristics  that are  similar  to  simulated  fish  trajectories.  This  work  may  lead to learning animal behavior and then formulating bio-inspired path planners for robots to operate in unknown environments."
27,Bhuvana,Krishnaswamy,,bkrishnaswamy3@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Algorithms and Protocols for Molecular Communication,"Advancements in synthetic biology and bioengineering have allowed us to utilize naturally occurring sensors as well as engineered biosensors in applications including monitoring, diagnostics, drug delivery, and more. In current systems, the biosensors are treated as standalone entities are not active components of a communication network. I envision an autonomous network of biosensors that can interact, cooperate, and respond like a natural system which would allow us to explore more opportunities for monitoring, diagnosis, and cure with a high level of accuracy. Existing communication networks are not designed to meet the challenges, constraints, and opportunities that arise from having biosensors as the source. 

In my research, I have focused on the design of communication algorithms for bacterial transceivers in a microfluidic chip; engineered bacteria as transceivers emitting chemical molecules (information) through a microfluidic channel. Biological transceivers have very high processing delays and low computational capacity compared to traditional RF transceivers which makes transfer of a single bit expensive in terms of data-rate and latency. I developed novel and practical algorithms around the theme of talk-less-say-more to minimize the number of signals in the channel and maximize the information conveyed. I developed a non-linear modulation called Time Elapse Communication (TEC), that encodes information in the number of clock cycles elapsed between the two trigger signals; TEC thus transmits two signals per frame irrespective of the frame length (in bits). I developed a addressing mechanism that embeds address in the amplitude of the signal and thus removing the need for addressing bits."
28,Jackson,McCormick,,jcmccorm@gatech.edu,Electrical Engineering,Ph.D.,"D-region Ionospheric Imaging Using VLF/LF Broadband Sferics, Forward Modeling, and Tomography","The D-region of the ionosphere (60-90 km altitude) is highly variable on timescales from fractions of a second to many hours, and on spatial scales from 10 km to many hundreds of km. VLF and LF (3-30kHz, 30-300kHz) radio waves are guided to global distances by reflecting off of the ground and the D-region, making the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG). Therefore, information about the current state of the ionosphere is encoded in received VLF/LF radio waves since they act like probes of the D-region. The return stroke of lightning is an impulsive event that radiates powerful broadband radio emissions in VLF/LF bands known as radio atmospherics. Lightning flashes occur about 40-50 times per second throughout the Earth. An average of ~2000 lightning storms occur each day with a mean duration of ~30 minutes creating a broad spatial and temporal distribution of lightning VLF/LF sources. 

With careful processing, we can recover high fidelity measurements of amplitude and phase of both the radial and azimuthal magnetic field sferic components. By comparison to a theoretical EIWG propagation model such as the Long Wave Propagation Capability (LWPC) developed by the US Navy, with a standard forward modeling approach, we can infer information about the current state of the D-region. Typically, the ionosphere is parametrized to reduce the dimensionality of the problem which usually results in an electron density vs altitude profile. For large distances (Greater than 1000 km), these results can be interpreted as path-averaged information. In contrast to studies using navy transmitters to study the D-region, the full spectral information allows for more complete information and less ambiguous inferred ionospheric parameters.

With the spatial breadth of lightning sources taken together with a broadly distributed VLF/LF receiver network, a dense set of measurements are acquired in a tomographic sense. Using the wealth of linear algebra and imaging techniques it is possible to produce a 2D image of the D-region electron density profile."

31,Yutao,Gong,,ygong61@gatech.edu,Chemical Engineering,Ph.D.,Metal-Organic Framework for Ethylene/Ethane Spearation,"Oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) is a promising route to convert natural gas (CH4) to value-added ethylene. However, the existing OCM catalysts will typically produce a large amount of by-products like ethane that is difficult to separate from ethylene due to their similar physical properties. In industry, these two gases are separated via high energy-consuming cryogenic high-pressure distillation. Therefore, there is significant motivation to develop a simple and effective separation method to afford low energy consumption and high ethylene purity. Metal organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates for use in this application due to their high surface areas, large pore volumes, high adsorption capacities and selectivity for specific adsorbates. 
Developing an understanding of adsorbate-surface and adsorbate-packing interactions between MOFs and ethylene is important because as ethylene is selectively adsorbed on the surface of MOF, we can use a temperature swing or pressure swing adsorption process to obtain ethylene in a fast and efficient way. The open metal sites of some specific MOFs like MOF-74 show strong adsorption selectivity for ethylene over ethane due to interactions. The M-OH groups, aromatic-CH groups and phenyl rings can also play an important role in the selective adsorption for ethylene via weak additive, supramolecular interactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons. In addition, the incorporation of metal ions like Cu+ and Ag+ inside the pores of MOF or ion exchange with functional groups can also enhance the interactions with ethylene through cation complexation.  This presentation will focus on our recent work in understanding the fixed-bed adsorption behavior of ethane and ethylene in metal-organic frameworks for developing a new separation process for treating OCM effluent."

At the cathode side, the oxygen reductionreaction (ORR) is the key reaction, for which Pt remains the most widely used catalyst. In order to leapfrog the current limits to Pt use, three main targets have to be achieved. First, is an enhancement of the catalytic activity per Pt atom; second, is a reduction of Pt loading; and  third is an increase the catalyst longevity. Here, we demonstrate the dual role of single graphene layer, both as a growth platform and as a protective cap for 2D Pt monolayers catalysts, where all three targets can be achieved. 

Using iterative under potential deposition (UPD), monolayers layers of Pt catalyst are grown on a monolayer. Intimate contact between Pt/graphene induces a localized compressive strain on Pt monolayers ranges 3-10% with an overall compressive strain of 3.5% according to extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis shows Pt monolayers fully wetting graphene with only a ~1 nm ultra-thin layer of Pt, while avoiding ripening as shown through TEM images. 

Pt/graphene hybrid catalysts show superior catalytic activity for ORR relative to the graphene-free counterparts. A combination of the graphene-imposed compressive strain and electron transfer, push the Pt d-band center up, lowering the overpotential needed for ORR to occur."

A large amount of research has been conducted to find a new gaseous insulating medium, but no promising alternatives have been found yet. This research investigates a new medium for high power switching, supercritical fluids (SCF). Compared to conventional insulation gases, supercritical fluids have many unique advantages such as high dielectric strength, high heat transfer capability, and low viscosity. By conducting preliminary experiments, the dielectric strength of supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) was confirmed to reach well beyond 100 kV/mm, which is more than sufficient to replace SF6 gas. Other supercritical fluids with potential extraordinary performances, such as ethane (C2H6), nitrous oxide (N2O), and octafluorocyclobutane (C4F8) will also be investigated. The poster describes related research activities at Georgia Tech's Plasma and Dielectrics Laboratory on supercritical fluids. This includes the development of a figure of merit to choose the most promising potential supercritical fluids, as well as analysis and experimental results on breakdown performances on supercritical fluids."

Epitaxial graphene nanoribbons can be produced (by thermal decomposition) on the sidewalls of20 nm deep trenches etched in the silicon terminated face of SiC. For these sidewall nanoribbons, sidearms form at the edges of the naturally occurring SiC terraces that intercept the trench (due to the unavoidable slight miscut of the crystal). Alternatively, sidearm-free nanoribbons can be produced by properly annealing SiC whereby step bunching produces large (20 nm high) substrate steps on which graphene subsequently grows. Conductive probe potentiometry was performed on both types of sidewall nanoribbons, providing transport characteristics as a function of length. As might be expected, the sidearms are found to significantly reduce the mean free paths (1Âµm) compared with the sidearm free ribbons (>10Âµm). In contrast, mean free paths of about 20nm are found for lithographically produced epigraphene nanoribbons and about"

In a warm-humid climate, indoor comfort can be maintained by an optimized interior temperature with a reduction in relative humidity through dehumidification and multiple air changes per hour. The attempt to solve this problem has been through the use of double skin facade, comprising of solar chimneys and perforated panels. A standard four-unit housing in any warm-humid climate can be considered. The surface area, form, and placement of solar chimneys can be optimized through computational methods to achieve best results (in terms of maximum surface area for solar heat gain thus inducing heightened stack effect). The pressure difference thus created, compels influx of natural air flow. The perforated DSF is composed of funnels with a nozzle towards the interior thus inducing throttling on the incoming air thus reducing its temperature on expansion by the Joule-Thompson effect. The space between the funnels is filled with insulating materials to maintain the isothermal condition. An attempt has been made to solve the feasibility of the system through mathematical calculations and CFD simulations and recording of resulting TSI through the true functionality of the system can be determined by experimentation on physical/life-size models. Conclusively, this could be a potential solution to indoor comfort in warm-humid climates with moderate wind speeds."

Drug resistance and the limited treatment options for the asymptomatic liver stage of infection are a persistent problem facing efforts to eradicate malaria. Two species of the malaria-causing protozoa Plasmodium, P. vivax and P. ovale, can form hypnozoites, a dormant form of the parasite's sporozoite life stage located in the host's liver. Hypnozoites do not cause symptoms, cannot be detected by blood tests, and can trigger a new occurrence of malaria months after the initial infection. Novel antimalarials are needed to target the liver stage of the parasite lifecycle to protect populations in malaria endemic regions. A promising source for new antimalarial compounds are marine organisms, which produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites. Screening a total of 1550 marine macroorganism extracts led to the identification of 124 extracts with activity against sporozoites of P. berghei, a species often used as a model organism for human malaria infection. The most promising compounds have come from a cyanobacterium Lyngbya sp. collected from the Lau Islands of Fiji which not only exhibited high potency towards sporozoites but also had low toxicity towards human liver cells. Fractionation of the antimalarial Lyngbya sp. extracts led to the isolation of two bioactive peptides, a cyclic depsipeptide and a modified linear peptide. Efforts are currently ongoing to fully characterize the bioactive compounds."

Either polyoxometalate (POM) or FeCl3 was used as the catalyst and charge-transfer agent at the anode. Over 90^% Faraday efficiency was achieved. In a thermal-insulation reactor, the heat energy could be maintained at a very low level for continuous operation. Compared to the best alkaline--water electrolysis reported in literature, the electrical-energy consumption could be 40^% lower with lignin electrolysis. At the anode, the Kraft lignin (KL) was oxidized to aromatic chemicals by POM or FeCl3, and reduced POM or Fe ions were regenerated during the electrolysis. Structure analysis of the residual KL indicated a reduction of the amount of hydroxyl groups and the cleavage of ether bonds. The results suggest that POM- or FeCl3-mediated electrolysis can significantly reduce the electrolysis energy consumption in hydrogen production and, simultaneously, depolymerize lignin to low-molecular-weight value-added aromatic chemicals."
42,Anish,Mukherjee,,anish.47@gatech.edu,Bioengineering,Ph.D.,Synchronization in Lymphangions: A Clue to Unravelling Body Fluid Homeostasis,"The lymphatic system consists of a network of capillaries, nodes and intrinsically contractile segments called lymphangions, which facilitates the clearance of interstitial fluid and hence the maintenance of tissue fluid volume. Dysfunctions in the lymphatic system, such as compromised pumping of the lymphangions, can lead to lymphedema, a condition characterized by excess interstitial fluid accumulation in the extremities of the body. The lymphangions are mechanosensitive units whose contractility is regulated by the transmural pressure and shear stress acting on it. The oscillatory nature of the transmural pressure and shear stress under physiologic conditions can affect the synchronized contraction of chains of lymphangions. To study the effects of oscillatory mechanical forces on the contractile function of lymphatic vessels, a custom perfusion system was used that allows the simultaneous control of average transmural pressure and pressure difference across the vessel. The critical shear stress required for inhibition of contraction was found to be significantly related to the diameter of the vessel. The lymphangions synchronize to an imposed oscillatory shear stress and the strength of the synchronization is defined using a novel metric utilizing wavelet transforms. The strength of synchronization is found to be significantly dependent on the difference between the intrinsic and applied frequency, and also on the difference between the imposed and critical shear stress at low applied frequencies. The synchronization of individual lymphangions to oscillatory mechanical forces is thus dependent on the mechanosensitivity of the vessel, and impaired mechanosensitivity might lead to impaired function of the lymphatic system."

In effect, the analysis of contemporary urban stadia projects necessitates the study of the very questions related to the city of the future: the impact of new technologies in shaping how mega projects are built, how climate change will shape the character of urban life and the infrastructure that supports it, and the socio-economic implications of these factors combined. Often thought of as an icon, the legacy of an important global event, or the symbolic identity for a city, the stadium must achieve more than mere functionality. It can and should generate urban redevelopment and regeneration. This study envisions the development of novel urban analytical methodologies to observe how this building impacts human behavior in the urban space. This methodology relies on the hypothesis that big data offers new information about urban space patterns of usage after the construction of large scale architecture. The use of big data as part of the design process may open up possibilities for place making professionals to interpret architectures' ability to attract people, affecting movement patterns through the urban space, and at the same time to re-visualize the real impact of stadia in the city. A new understanding of the impact of stadia-related architecture and urban design can reveal unexplored economic opportunities and architecture's capacity to define the city of the future, amplifying the breadth of legacy to be achieved by stadiums in their host cities."

In this paper, we demonstrate a novel fabrication method for creating magnetic artificial cilia capable of such a biologically inspired asymmetric beating pattern essential for inducing microfluidic transport at low Reynolds number. The cilia are fabricated using a lithographic process in conjunction with deposition of magnetic nickel iron permalloy to create flexible filaments that can be manipulated by varying an external magnetic field. A rotating permanent magnet is used to actuate the cilia. We examine the kinematics of a cilium and demonstrate that the cilium motion is defined by an interplay among elastic, magnetic, and viscous forces. Specifically, the forward stroke is induced by the rotation of the magnet which bends the cilium, whereas the recovery stroke is defined by the straightening of the deformed cilium, releasing accumulated elastic potential energy. This difference in dominating forces acting during the forward stroke and the recovery stroke leads to an asymmetric beating pattern of the cilium. Such magnetic cilia can find applications in microfluidic pumping, mixing, and other fluid handling processes."

The major bottleneck for commercialization, however, is low stability, especially towards moisture and polar solvents. 
Our strategy utilizes non-linear block copolymers with distinct polymer blocks as nanoreactors to simultaneously create nanostructured materials with precisely tuned dimensions as well as enhanced stability that cannot be achieved via conventional ligand assisted methods. 
In our research, we have successfully synthesized Cs-based perovskite QDs and quantum rods (QR) with tailored dimensions that are intimately and permanently tethered with hydrophobic polystyrene by capitalizing on rationally designed star-like block copolymer poly(acrylic acid)-b-polystyrene (PAA-b-PS) and bottlebrush-like block copolymer PAA-b-PS as nanoreactors. By synthesizing the copolymer blocks with low polydispersity via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), we accurately control the size of the perovskite QDs and QRs, thus allowing strict control over light harvesting and emission at desired wavelengths. FWHM of PS-Capped CsPbBr3 QD PL was as low as 17.7nm and PL tunable from 400nm to 700nm. 
Intriguingly, each PS-Capped CsPbX3 QD, for the first time, has a separate protective shell that can be precisely tailored to any desired length/thickness. The permanently tethered PS shell on the CsPbX3 surface showed striking improvements in terms of stability. PS-Capped CsPbBr3 QD QY in solution was stable for more than 2months. Also, PS-Capped CsPbBr3 QDs showed up to 20x increase in water stability compared to conventional ligand-capped CsPbBr3 QDs."
46,Francisco,Quintero,,f@gatech.edu,Materials Science and Engineering,Ph.D.,Operando synchrotron measurement of strain evolution in individual alloying anode particles for lithium batteries,"Alloying anode materials for Li-ion batteries have theoretical specific capacities between 3-10 times higher than commercial graphitic anodes. These high capacities cause substantial volumetric expansion/contraction upon lithium insertion/extraction, which is related to capacity decay with cycling. Two of the most attractive alloying anode materials are silicon and germanium. Both of them exhibit a two phase reaction upon initial lithiation in which a sharp interface separates the pristine crystal from a highly lithiated amorphous phase. Multiple studies have been devoted to measuring and modeling the mechanical properties of these systems, but direct measurement of stress/strain of the crystalline phase has not been previously reported for single particles. This is critical knowledge for understanding the influence of stress and strain on reaction kinetics. In this study, we use operando coherent x-ray diffraction to track the evolution of the crystalline core of individual Ge microparticles during lithiation. The intensity and position of the diffraction peak provided detailed information regarding reaction mechanisms. Since lithiation converts the crystal to an amorphous material, the diffracted intensity was used to monitor the extent of reaction. Similarly, the changes in the position of the Bragg peak are a direct measure of the strain along the corresponding crystallographic direction. Strain was observed to increase monotonically up to 0.23 % compressive strain, which agrees well with analytical modeling results. This compressive strain in the crystalline core arises due to the volumetric expansion of the outer shell of the particle, compressing the core. These observations provide important experimental insight into the mechanics of large-volume-change phase transformations in alloying anodes, which is critical for improving cyclability and performance of higher-capacity batteries."

Previous studies have mostly focused on the chemochromic effects of some conjugated polymers by monitoring absorption change versus chemical dopant levels, which requires bulky spectrometer and complicated software for simple analysis. Therefore, researchers has been working on the development of light-weight, simple detection modules for such applications.
Herein, we report our findings of developing new conjugated polymeric semiconductor in thin-film transistors (TFTs) with electronic responses to low dose of acids in gas phase or in solution, which does not require complicated detector nor heavy analytical equipment set-ups. Poly(2,7-dihexyl-4-methyl-9-(5'-methyl-[2,2'-bithiazol]-5-yl)benzo[3,8]phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone) (PNDI2Tz) was synthesized through Stille coupling. Side-chain engineering enhanced polymer solubility for easier processing. PNDI2Tz UV-vis absorption spectra showed distinct signals of acid doping in solution and thin film with absorbance ratio at 540 nm (Ipristine/Idoped) at 51.2; such ratio is comparable to state-of-the-art chemochromic sensors in UV-vis detection range. PNDI2Tz is proven to possess pure electron mobility as high as 0.08 cm2/Vs, which is close to the bench mark commercially available electron transporting polymer N2200 by FlexterraTM. TFTs were fabricated and tested against various acid doping, and detection limit were measured to be less than 50 ppm in gas. PDNI2Tz thin-film transistors is shown to be highly repeatable with over 300 doping cycles with no change in mobility."

The proposed devices are i) broadband, ii) theoretically capable of either guiding or focusing the wave without any aberrations. These introduced structures are employed in thin plates with a variety of application in cloaking, wave focusing, and wave bending for electronic devices.  We present the design of a perfect broadband cloak for flexural waves by using a nonlinear transformation in the region of the cloak. Through direct simulation of the governing equations and experimental validation, we show this cloak, as well, maintains a consistently high cloaking efficiency over a broad range of frequencies. In addition, we design a flexural GRIN lens in a thin plate by smoothly varying the plate's rigidity.  We numerically explore our Continuous Profile GRIN lens (CP-GRIN lens) and then experimentally validate an implemented design. Finally, we design a wave beaming structure in a thin plate by smoothly varying the plate's rigidity, and thus its phase velocity to bend and direct the elastic waves along any curved trajectories over a broad frequency range. We numerically explore our continuous profile for the phase velocity and then experimentally validate an implemented design.

The first step toward this goal is to broaden the specificity of the translation machinery to incorporate unnatural amino acids and other monomers. We have demonstrated that computational analysis can be harnessed to design protein variants with diverse phenotypes including recognition and acceptance of unnatural amino acids. Our protein library is designed to probe the association between EF-Tu and aminoacylated tRNAs in order to efficiently deliver tRNAs acylated with unnatural amino acids, as well as other monomers, to the ribosome.

Our study population is infants born in 2011 to mothers aged 10-19 in which both mother and child were on Medicaid at time of birth.  Causal effects of teen pregnancy were found by matching teen and adult mothers and performing a pairwise comparison for each outcome. The mothers were matched using demographics, health status, and Medicaid eligibility. Outcomes of the infants were restricted to the first year of birth and included addiction rates, health status, foster care, number of Emergency department and wellness visits. 
Methods: Teen mothers were first paired with their infants using a state case id, and then the remaining teen mothers were paired via demographics (hospital of birth, ethnicity, and zip code).  Paired teen mothers were then matched to adult mothers via health impact factors.  Lastly, matched adult mothers were paired with their infants using the same pairing method used for the teen mothers.
For the binary variables, a proportion test was used to determine a statistical difference between the two infant groups.  A Poisson ratio test was used for the count data. 
Results: We discovered statistically significant differences for low birth weight and ED visits.  Teens were 2% more likely to give birth to infants with low birth weight and their infants had on average 30% more ED visits."

Methods: An anonymous 15-question survey was distributed to pre-hospital and in-hospital providers through social media outlets across the United States. All questions were required to be answered on the survey (n=-120). The preliminary survey was open for 15 days.
Results: 85.7% of providers worked in a pre-hospital setting and 14.3% of the providers worked in a in-hospital setting (n=120). The average work experience in the field was 13 years and the average amount of patients seen in one month was 65. Providers used the bag valve mask on average of 4.25 times in one month. 72.5% of providers had problems with the standard bag valve mask. 69.2% of the providers claim that there is a problem creating a seal with the bag valve mask and they, themselves, had issues creating a mask seal on average of 2.2 times per month. 53% of the providers believe that users deliver inappropriate ventilation with the standard bag valve mask. 80% of the providers believe that an automated ventilation device to deliver accurate rate and volume to patients would be useful to providers, instead of the standard bag valve mask.
Conclusion: A patient specific positive pressure ventilation system that delivers an accurate rate and volume of air to patients and reduces adverse effects of manual bag valve ventilation is needed in the pre-hospital and in-hospital settings."

Currently, impact analysis for a single PV system takes anywhere between 50-120 hours to complete, which becomes an infeasible option for utilities, considering the ever increasing interconnection requests. To better streamline the process, utilities are limiting the size of the allowable PV systems based on a rough estimate, rather than a detailed analysis. As a result, customers are not allowed to install larger PV systems, that otherwise would have no impact on the distribution feeder. This research aims to bridge this gap. The goal is to utilize machine learning and predictive modeling to perform a detailed impact analysis of solar PV systems (or any other renewable resource) within a matter of minutes as opposed to days. The proposed simulation tool will be able to perform a high resolution comprehensive assessment with great accuracy and provide utilities with quantifiable impact metrics to quickly determine any potential issues with the filed interconnection requests."

The most prevalent strategy in controlling color is to control optical gap which involves changing the structures of conjugated backbones, while side chains are only viewed as solubilizing groups. Recent studies in solid-state applications of conjugated polymers have begun to focus on side chain engineering, collectively observing that this approach could greatly enhance the charge carrier mobility, field-effect transistors and the power conversion efficiency in organic solar cells. These studies have yet to be focused on redox active polymers. To understand what effects side chains engineering has on optoelectronic properties of ECPs, we designed and synthesized five polymers with branched and linear alkoxy side chains. Increasing the steric hindrance by increasing the branched side chains from the linear side chains within the family of polymers results in an increase in the onset of oxidation and higher optical gap. This results in a color change from purple to orange. In addition, we observe a decrease spectral contrast and slower switching speeds. Investigation of the polymers by differential scanning calorimetry suggests higher degree of regularity in the polymers with linear side chains. Based on these results, it is apparent that steric hindrance in side chains plays an important role in optoelectronic properties of ECPs."
58,Nil,Gurel,,nil@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Quantifying the Efficacy of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation through the Communication between the Brain and the Heart,"The brain (nervous system) and the heart (cardiovascular system) share an active and reciprocal dialogue, continuously modulating each other's function. For persons who have experienced traumatic events, the reminders of these events affect both the brain and heart acutely, and can later develop into stress-related brain disorders. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (t-VNS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation therapy for treating the disorders of the nervous system, and possibly have downstream effects on the cardiovascular system due to the intimate relationship between the vagus nerve and the heart. Despite the availability of handheld t-VNS technologies, questions remain about the optimal stimulation parameters and dosage recommendations. Research in this area is typically limited to expensive analyses, restricting the usage outside of clinical settings. In this work, we quantified non-invasive peripheral cardiovascular measurements as physiological biomarkers of t-VNS efficacy. We focused on two physiological biomarkers closely linked to sympathetic (fight or flight) and arterial dilation / constriction: pre-ejection period (PEP) of the heart, and the amplitude of peripheral photoplethysmogram (PPG). A total of eleven human subjects participated in a multi-day study, undergoing active or sham t-VNS. Subjects receiving active t-VNS experienced significant increase in PEP (i.e. reduced sympathetic tone), while subjects receiving sham stimulus showed a decrease, following trauma recalls. Additionally, for t-VNS applications without intervention, active subjects experienced relatively higher increase in PPG amplitude, compared to the sham group. We suggest that PEP and PPG amplitude may be non-invasive, real-time biomarkers of t-VNS efficacy, in the presence of trauma recalls, or without intervention."
59,Sandjar,Kozubaev,,skozubaev3@gatech.edu,Digital Media,Ph.D.,Surveillance Imaginaries: Using Computer Vision Simulation to Create and Contest Images of the Future,"In recent years, surveillance technologies have been proliferating around the world both for commercial and governmental purposes. Speculative and Critical Design (SCD) refers to a mode of design inquiry and cultural production oriented towards questioning the status quo and challenging assumptions without necessarily offering solutions. This contrasts with more traditional role of design in which satisfaction of functional, emotional and other needs of consumers as well as commercial success is the primary concern. 
This poster will demonstrate the use of SCD as a research method in imagining the future of surveillance in public spaces. The first project is Surveillance Footage Generator (SFG). It uses computer vision algorithms to create footage from imaginary surveillance systems where people are profiled and labeled with user-defined categories. This allows users to think through future uses of citizen and consumer data in surveillance systems to critically reflect on the nature of surveillance today and in the future. The second project is un_seen. The project uses a crowdsourcing platform to evaluate individual frames of a surveillance video to demonstrate how human judgements can create representations of imaginary surveillance systems. Each contributor was asked to identify and evaluate a person or people in a single frame. Hundreds of frames were reassembled to create a moving image that resembles a surveillance recording processed with computer vision. 
SFG and un_seen were designed to create surveillance imaginaries, representations of futures or alternative presents that help question and contest the nature of technology and their role in society. These projects contribute to the field of SCD by offering new media-based participatory research practices."

Secondly, we want to  learn from the exercise data, what known or novel voice parameters are responsible for specific speech impediments and what exercises may be fed back to the patients for optimized improvements in the speech quality. Essentially, this poster demonstrates how much we have been able to learn categorization of the voice-exercises and the methodology used to accomplish this. 

Specifically, we have extracted portions of the speech files and categorized them into training, validation and test cases. We then randomly create Support Vector Machine classifiers to learn to discriminate between a specific extracted exercise-file section and a subsection of all other speech files. Hence, we have a pool of experts who can distinguish a specified speech section in the training pool from every other speech sections in the same pool. We then make them validate the classifying power of each expert using the validation set. When an expert gets a prediction correct, we improve its weight and penalize the weights of those who get predictions wrong in the validation set. 

Lastly, we test our algorithm using an out-sample test set. On the test set, we obtain a vote based on the weight of the classifiers and we make a prediction on the suggestions of the best classifiers."

To study some of the more lasting ecological impacts of the spill, we collected zooplankton across annual summer cruises in the Northern Gulf of Mexico starting shortly after the sealing of the wellhead in 2010. Zooplankton were collected in paired day and night tows throughout discrete intervals of the water column and separated by body sizes (200um-500um, 500um-1000um, 1000-2000um, 2000um-4000um, and 4000um+) to represent the pelagic community at a scale that links single-celled members to higher trophic levels. Through bulk zooplankton stable C and N isotope analysis, we found that zooplankton community responded markedly to heavy oil inputs following the spill in 2010 and has shown recovery patterns distinct from microbial and primary producers suggesting long-lasting impacts to community structure."

However, electrification planning in developing countries has largely ignored industrial and commercial electricity requirements. We consider power distribution network planning for a small range area (e.g. 1 kilometer square) with selection of three energy sources: stand-alone solar PV, diesel driven mini grids and normal power grids. We divide the consumers into three categories: residential, commercial and industrial. Each category has an electricity consumption target denoted as different tiers defined by the World Bank. Our goal is to decide the right energy source for all consumers and design the underlying power distribution network. We develop a mixed integer optimization model with objective in minimizing the total cost. We show how industrial and commercial electricity requirements at this small scale can be integrated into national electrification plans."
64,Xinyang,Zheng,,xzheng48@gatech.edu,Aerospace Engineering,Master's,Fatigue and Creep Life Prediction for Aircraft Engine Turbine Blade Based on Fatigue and Creep models,"Turbine design and manufacture is done in the industry, however, the evaluation of the lifespan of main components may be not enough. Various papers in the literature did an excellent job with respect to turbine life estimation from different perspectives. Fatigue and creep life computations using created life models based on the real test data and implement in NPSS engine model are done in this research. In order to demonstrate the capability of life estimation, fatigue model is created with specific running cycles, and estimate number of cycles to reach fatigue failure is calculated. Since the fatigue model is based on the strain amplitude during the material test, it is assumed that the number of changes of the RPM of turbine rotor is counted as the number of running cycles, because the change of RPM would change the strain amplitude. Moreover, creep model is based on temperature and Larson Miller parameter. As temperature goes up, the Larson Miller parameter also increases, but time to reach creep failure goes down. The parameter is nonlinear and changes with temperature and running time. In addition, the interaction between fatigue and creep is also introduced, involving Palmgren-Miner cumulative damage rule and Robinson methods. Ä°f cycle to reach fatigue failure is really high, few numbers of changes of the RPM or the first few numbers of flights is not enough to dominate the blade life. As time goes, the fatigue takes over and affects the blade life rather than creep. NPSS is also introduced to build the high bypass turbine engine as engine model. To reach to the desired requirements, input pressure on first stage high pressure turbine is way below the pressure of test data, which can be concluded that the blade life is higher than what is computed. Ä°n the demonstration of IN738, the remaining time was roughly 2634 hours with 50 as the number of cycles for one single flight before reaching to the next failure. By using the correct Larson Miller parameter, the remaining running time was close to the real test data. Two more materials are also involved in this analysis. Based on the real test data, it can be found which materials are more sensitive to Larson Miller parameter, which can predict the blade life more accurately."
65,Andres,Caballero,,adcaballero@gatech.edu,Biomedical engineering,MBA,The effect of chordae tendineae rupture on left ventricle-valve dynamics: a fluid-structure interaction analysis,"Competent mitral valve (MV) closure depends on a well-orchestrated force balance across the anterior and posterior (PML) leaflets, the chordae tendineae, the mitral annulus, and the papillary muscles. Chordae rupture disrupts the link between the MV and the left ventricle (LV), causing mitral regurgitation (MR), the most common valvular disease. Cardiac modeling can help us better understand the complex functional environment of the LV-valve complex. However, accurately modeling left heart (LH) dynamics has been challenging, since it is a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomenon that involves large deformations experienced by the leaflets and the cardiac wall, the nonlinear elastic behavior of the valvular tissue, and the pulsatile hemodynamic load. Towards this goal, novel FSI LH models with detailed chordae structure are develop to investigate the impact of chordae rupture on LV-valve dynamics. A control LH model with normal MV function was modified to simulate 7 chordae rupture conditions, representing a pathological process in which minimal chordae rupture precedes a more extensive rupture. The severity of the resultant MR was quantified by the regurgitant fraction. Regarding the force balance of the mitral apparatus, results showed that basal/strut chordae were the major load-bearing chordae. As the number of ruptured chordae increased, while basal/strut tension decreased, marginal and/or intermediate chordae load increased. This study also found that chordae rupture in a specific PML scallop does not necessarily involves an increase in the stress of the entire prolapsed leaflet. Finally, different eccentric and non-eccentric regurgitant jets were identified, and cardiac efficiency was quantified."
66,Fatiesa,Sulejmani,,fatiesa.sulejmani@gatech.edu,Biomedical Engineering,Ph.D.,"Comparative mechanical, morphological, and microstructural properties of the mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets and chordae tendinae","Introduction: Proper tricuspid valve (TV) leaflet coaptation requires harmonious function of all of the tricuspid apparatus (TA) constituents; any impairment may result in regurgitation (TR). Despite extensive research devoted to the mitral apparatus, the TA has been largely neglected, and comparative studies are nonexistent. A thorough characterization of the mitral (MV) and TV leaflets and chordae was therefore conducted in this study.
Methods: Chords were grouped by leaflet and insertion point (strut, basal, marginal), and subjected to uniaxial testing and Verhoeff Van-Gieson staining; leaflets were subjected to biaxial testing and second harmonic generation imaging. Mechanical and morphological parameters were quantified and compared. 
Results: No major differences in leaflet mechanical properties, morphology, or collagen structure were found. 
For the chords, the septal tricuspid leaflet (STL) and posterior mitral leaflet (PML) were not observed to have distinguishable strut chords. The STL also had the shortest and most extensible chords. There was no difference in mechanical properties for chords within a leaflet. Between leaflets, the anterior (ATL) and posterior (PTL) tricuspid leaflet chords were mechanically similar, although significantly stiffer than STL chords. The anterior mitral leaflet chords were stiffer but similarly extensible.  While MV chords had similar stiffness, PML chords were less extensible, on par with ATL and PTL chords.
Discussion: These findings suggest that, despite similar mechanical and structural leaflet properties between valves, the chordae tendinae may compensate for their different mechanical and anatomical environments. These results allude to the special consideration needed for septally-located chords for surgical planning and numerical simulations."
67,Evan,Mallen,,esmallen@gatech.edu,City & Regional Planning,Ph.D.,Thermal Impacts of Built and Vegetated Environments on Local Microclimates in the Tech Climate Network,"The physical context of the Georgia Institute of Technology campus is changing. Temperatures in the Atlanta region have been rising more rapidly than in previous decades, leaving the Georgia Tech campus and population increasingly vulnerable to a growing range of health, outdoor comfort, and infrastructure-related impacts. More effective monitoring of climate trends on campus, in concert with climate-responsive design strategies, can lessen both the human impacts and infrastructure costs of rising temperatures. In response to these trends, the Georgia Institute of Technology's Urban Climate Lab has established a dense network of temperature sensors throughout the campus to identify the location of hot spots, measure the impact of ongoing development on micro-climatic conditions, and assess how the use of vegetation and cool materials around campus can moderate warming trends. We analyzed the temperature of 25 microclimates across campus during the summer of 2017, and correlated them with land cover data from the department of Capital Planning & Space Management. We found that Georgia Tech's urban heat island is not one large hot spot, but rather a collection of distinct microclimates with average high temperatures ranging from roughly 1.4 to 6.8Â°F warmer than our rural control. We found that streets, sidewalks and buildings significantly sustain high minimum temperatures, while tree canopy significantly reduces maximum temperatures. This information can help urban planners prepare for rising temperatures from a warming climate and increased urbanization. Heat mitigation planning that incorporates vegetative strategies can significantly protect vulnerable populations adapt to extreme temperatures and enhance local resilience."

The leucine zipper pair, ZE and ZR, allows for high fidelity and high affinity heterodimerization, and may be used to create an affinity immobilization system.2,3 In our work, enzymes are recombinantly fused to ZE with an amino acid linker to provide adequate spacing, while a protein-based calcium-phosphate particle is constructed with ZR. The hierarchically structured porous calcium phosphate supraparticles serve as a modular support for enzyme immobilization.4

A glutamate leucine zipper (ZE) was added to both a chimeric amine dehydrogenase (AmDH)5 and formate dehydrogenase from C. boidinii (cbFDH) using a library of amino acid linkers varying in length, proline content, and terminal orientation. The linker candidate which retained the highest activity for both binding and catalytic activity was identified for each enzyme. Only one linker construct for each enzyme exhibited activity similar to the unfused enzyme, and the preferred linker for each enzyme varied significantly. This highlights the necessity to create a variety of linkers when designing a new fusion protein to find the composition with the highest activity. The enzymes were immobilized in supraparticles through ZE/ZR dimerization, and retained greater than 80% of the soluble activity."

Epoxy based FR4 substrate is the primary insulating materials used in many commercially available electronic devices. One way to reduce the dielectric constant of epoxy FR4 substrate is to introduce pores into the substrate. The pore needs to be sufficiently small in order to maintain the mechanical property of the substrate. In this study, we used a modified oligomer, epoxide functionalized polypropylene carbonate as the porogen material. The modified oligomer ensures good miscibility of the porogen material with the rest of the formulation. By customerized slow-ramping curing of the formulation, followed by the decomposition of oligomers at higher temperature, the porous structure could be created. To maintain the good electrical property, the resulting porous film was further treated with silane-based vapor to create hydrophobic group on the inner side of the pore walls. The resulted porous epoxy film has lower dielectric constant with reduced dielectric loss."

This project proposes a novel methodology to identify necessity entrepreneurs that exploits variations in the employees' risk of being unemployed and nets out the confounding effect of opportunities. Using a rich dataset of startup founders in life sciences, we show that, as unemployment rate increases, the fraction of necessity entrepreneurs also rises. This finding is not driven by necessity entrepreneurs crowding out opportunity entrepreneurs when unemployment is high. Additionally, we find that startups entirely founded by necessity entrepreneurs show worse financial and innovative performance outcomes than startups founded by at least one opportunity entrepreneur. Finally, having necessity entrepreneurs as founders explains approximately 11 percentage points of the negative effect of unemployment on startups' performance."

Asthma currently affects approximately 17.3 million Americans, including nearly 5 million children, making it the most common chronic respiratory disorder in the United States. To encourage better management in order to reduce symptoms, we proposed a mobile game for asthma management. We found that most of apps for asthma are dedicated and those for asthma tracking are less interactive. Inspired by SpiroSmart, we've built an app that featured pulmonary measurement, tracking and education. We've attempted to make this asthma management app more interactive to increase the patient engagement by incorporating gamification into the app. Our approach was to develop a breath input function that will analyze the lung capacity of a patient by utilizing the built-in microphone of the smartphone. We then intended to propel the rocket by using the breath input of the patient during the game."

To be used in surveillance programs, a zinc status diagnostic test must be inexpensive, easy to administer, nearly equipment-free, and fast-responding. To meet these requirements, bacterial cells were first engineered to sense and respond to environmental zinc concentrations.  The engineered cells produce one of three different pigments-- violacein (purple), lycopene (red), and beta-carotene (orange) to indicate low, borderline, and healthy levels of zinc.  A second, paper-based test has also been developed that uses the cellular lysate all of the proteins inside of the cell to sense and respond to zinc concentrations.  This test uses the same underlying cellular machinery as the bacterial-based test and produces different colors to indicate different zinc levels in less than one hour.   The test can be freeze dried onto paper, stably stored and shipped to the testing site, and activated with just a finger prick of blood."
73,Songcheng,Wang,,swang428@gatech.edu,Chemical Engineering,Ph.D.,Improving the Waste Paper Recycling Process by a Novel Solid-Liquid Separation Method,"More than 70% of the paper products that we use every day are made from recycled papers. There is an important step called de-inking during this recycling process, which is to selectively remove some solid contaminants (ink particles) from water and to ensure the brightness of the final paper product.

The traditional technology is called flotation de-inking, which relies on the adsorption of hydrophobic ink particles onto air bubble surface. In recent decades, however, the properties of ink has changed from being hydrophobic to being hydrophilic, thus the traditional method does not work anymore.

Our method (oil-coated bubble flotation) is to coat the air bubble surface with a thin layer of oil, making its surface less hydrophobic compared with the uncoated bubble. In this way, we shall be able to remove ink particles from water more efficiently. So far we have demonstrated that this novel method is very promising from thermodynamic, kinetic and dynamic perspectives and we have also shown that it has significant economic impact compared with the current technology."
74,Matthew,Boebinger,,mboebinger@gatech.edu,Materials Science and Engineering,Ph.D.,In situ Multiscale Investigation of Reaction Pathways in a Sulfide Material for Sodium and Lithium Batteries,"Sodium-ion batteries are attractive due to their potentially lower cost than lithium-ion systems. However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ means that candidate electrode materials often undergo more substantial volumetric changes during reaction when compared to Li-ion batteries, and these changes must be understood and controlled for the development of electrode materials with long cycle life. In this study, multiple in situ techniques are used to investigate nanoscale-to-macroscale transformation pathways in Cu2S (a sulfide electrode material) during electrochemical reaction with Na and Li. In situ and ex situ x-ray diffraction reveal that the macroscale phase transformations in Cu2S electrodes are similar within both Na and Li cells; the material undergoes initial intercalation followed by conversion in both cases. However, in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the nanoscale reaction pathways differ significantly. During sodiation, Cu2S particles undergo a local phase separation that results in Cu nanocrystals surrounding a shell of Na2S. This leads to complete destruction of the initial Cu2S lattice, as opposed to the retention of the lattice during the displacement reaction in the lithiation case. These different reaction mechanisms likely contribute to observed differences in electrochemical signatures in Na and Li cells. Despite these dissimilarities, Na/Cu2S electrochemical cells are shown to exhibit excellent cycle life (negligible capacity decay over 400 cycles), which is similar to the Li case. Thus, although the more substantial volume changes during the sodiation of Cu2S induce a new reaction pathway, they do not cause accelerated capacity decay, as is commonly argued for Na-ion materials. These results suggest that other large-volume-change electrode materials may also be engineered for long cycle life in next-generation Na-ion batteries."

However, there has only been one study to date investigating within-person affect spin. In an experience sampling study, we investigate relationships between daily affect spin and end of day fatigue. Further, we investigate emotion regulation and negative affect as mediators of this relationship.

77,Ifayoyinsola,Ibikunle,,iibikunle3@gatech.edu,Chemical Engineering,Ph.D.,"Improving ISORROPIA II atmospheric aerosol pH predictions: A 20 week study on Birkenes, Norway","Although atmospheric aerosols (e.g. dust) are only microns in size, they have an impact on climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Specifically, the effects of acid processing of mineral dust on marine ecosystem productivity (e.g. photosynthesis) is of considerable importance. Studies have shown that this acidification process regulates the bioavailability of micronutrients (such as Iron (Fe) and Phosphorus (P)) found in dust.  Therefore, pH plays a critical role in characterizing the chemical transformation of aerosols before they deposit to the ocean. State of the art thermodynamic model, ISORROPIA II, is used to compute the pH of aerosols. In addition to pH, ISORROPIA II predicts the equilibrium phase state and respective concentrations of aerosol constituents. Predictions from ISORROPIA II can be validated against in-situ observations. Results from a 20 week analysis of in-situ measurements from Birkenes, Norway showed that the partitioning of semi-volatile species was in good agreement with model predictions when nonvolatile cations (NVCs) were excluded from calculations. This finding suggests that cations are solely present in the coarse mode fraction of aerosols. Moreover, model predictions were improved when HNO3 concentrations were averaged based on RH, implying that initial discrepancies are attributed to instrument resolution and environmental factors.  The accuracy of these pH calculations is crucial for quantifying the composition of aerosol constituents prior to ocean deposition. The new discoveries made from this work can profoundly impact ecosystems, with great but highly uncertain impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycles, and hence global climate, biodiversity and food security."

Surprisingly, mice expressing Tyr423His mutant myocilin, corresponding to a severe glaucoma-causing mutation (Tyr437His) in human subjects, do not develop glaucoma. To address possible protein-level discrepancies between mouse and human OLF which might lead to this outcome, biophysical properties of mouse OLF were characterized for comparison with those of human OLF. The 1.55 Ã… resolution crystal structure of mouse myocilin OLF reveals an asymmetric 5-bladed Î²-propeller that is nearly indistinguishable from previous structures of human OLF, including the location of a conserved calcium binding site in the central cavity. Stabilities of wild type and selected mutant mouse OLFs resemble those of their human OLF equivalents, including characteristic stabilization in the presence of calcium. Amyloid aggregation kinetics for wild type mouse OLF domain are even faster than for human OLF, yet both proteins exhibit similar, linear fibril morphology. Taken together, our results indicate that the phenotypic differences observed between the Tyr423His mutant myocilin mouse model and human subjects harboring the analogous Tyr437His myocilin mutation do not arise from physico-chemical differences between mouse and human OLF. Other factors, such as eye physiology or genetics, are likely at play."

Consequently, controlling the recruitment of MSCs can be utilized to therapeutically improve bone healing and to treat inherited bone diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta. In this study, we utilized sphingosine-1- phosphate (S1P) signaling to mobilize of MSCs into the blood and to recruit MSCs to sites of injury to heighten bone formation. S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3) knock-out causes for an enhancement of circulating Sca1+
putative mesenchymal progenitor cells, alluding to S1P3's role in retaining MSCs within the bone marrow. VPC01091, a small molecule that antagonizes S1P3, promoted acute migration of CD44+/CD29+/CD90+/Sca-1+ cells MSCs into the blood as early as 1.5 hours after treatment. Antagonism of S1PR3 also amplified bone volume in a subcutaneous ectopic bone formation model and significantly enhanced bone healing in a cranial bone defect suggesting that mobilized MSCs may home to injuries to contribute to healing. Additionally, we employed this MSC mobilization methodology to generate space in the bone marrow niche to enable the subsequent engraftment of exogenous transplanted MSCs as a means to enrich MSC replacement therapies. By utilizing VPC01091 to clear the bone marrow niche of endogenous MSCs, exogenous MSC transplants demonstrated improved engraftment within 24 hours of transplantation. MSC mobilization through S1PR3 antagonism is a promising treatment option to improve bone healing with endogenous MSCs and efficacy outcomes for MSC transplantation therapies for bone diseases."

Focused ultrasound (FUS), when combined with circulating microbubbles, provides a noninvasive method to locally and transiently disrupt the BBB/BTB. While several studies have demonstrated its potential for targeted drug delivery, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the impact of this method on the pharmacokinetics of anticancer agents in the brain microenvironment. We examined the impact of focused ultrasound in combination with microbubbles (FUS) on the transport of two anticancer agents, doxorubicin and ado-trastuzumab emtansine - T-DM1, across the BBB/BTB in a model of breast cancer brain metastasis using i) intravital microscopy, ii) immunostaining and iii) drug transport mathematical modeling. Multiphoton microscopy demonstrated higher doxorubicin extravasation and penetration after the application of FUS as compared to control (non-FUS). Quantification of the T-DM1 distribution around tumor blood vessels demonstrated a significant increase in penetration 4 hours after FUS as compared to non-FUS. Assessment of the temporal evolution of the drug concentration in the interstitial space along with experiment-specific parameterization of the mathematical model revealed that these transient changes are due to transition from diffusion-dominated to more efficient convective drug transport after FUS. In conclusion, FUS in combination with microbubbles is able to induce significant disruption of the BBB/BTB leading to profound increase in the penetration of anticancer agents in brain tumors."
83,Maria,Soto-Giron,,juliana.soto@gatech.edu,Bioinformatics,Ph.D.,Characterization of biofilms developing on hospital shower hoses and implications for nosocomial infections,"Although the source of drinking water (DW) used in hospitals is commonly disinfected, biofilms on water pipelines are refuge to bacteria, including possibly pathogens, which survive different disinfection strategies. These biofilm communities remain poorly characterized by culture-independent approaches that circumvent the limitations of conventional monitoring efforts. Hence, the frequency of opportunistic pathogens in DW biofilms and how biofilm members withstand high doses of disinfectants and/or chlorine residuals in the water supply remain speculative. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of microbial communities growing on five hospital shower hoses using both 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacterial isolates and whole-genome shotgun metagenome sequencing. The resulting data revealed a Mycobacterium-like population, closely related to M. rhodesiae and M. tusciae, to be the predominant taxon in all five samples, and its nearly complete draft genome was recovered. In contrast, the fraction recovered by culture was mostly affiliated to Proteobacteria, such as members of the genera Sphingomonas, Blastomonas, and Porphyrobacter. The biofilm community harbored genes related to disinfectant tolerance (2.34% of the total annotated proteins), and a lower abundance of virulence determinants related to colonization and evasion of the host immune system. Several copies of genes potentially conferring resistance to beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, amphenicol, and quinolone antibiotics were also detected. Collectively, our results underscore the need for understanding the genetic network of DW biofilms using metagenomic approaches. This information could lead to more robust management practices that minimize risks associated with exposure to opportunistic pathogens and pathogenicity genes in hospitals."
84,Mattia,Fazzini,,mattia.fazzini@gatech.edu,Computer Science,Ph.D.,Automated Cross-Platform Inconsistency Detection for Mobile Apps,"Testing of Android apps is particularly challenging due to the fragmentation of the Android ecosystem in terms of both devices and operating system versions. Developers must in fact ensure not only that their apps behave as expected, but also that the apps' behavior is consistent across platforms. To support this task, we propose DiffDroid, a new technique that helps developers automatically find cross-platform inconsistencies (CPIs) in mobile apps. DiffDroid combines input generation and differential testing to compare the behavior of an app on different platforms and identify possible inconsistencies. Given an app, DiffDroid (1) generates test inputs for the app, (2) runs the app with these inputs on a reference device and builds a model of the app behavior, (3) runs the app with the same inputs on a set of other devices, and (4) compares the behavior of the app on these different devices with the model of its behavior on the reference device. We implemented DiffDroid and performed an evaluation of our approach on 5 benchmarks and over 130 platforms. Our results show that DiffDroid can identify CPIs on real apps efficiently and with a limited number of false positives. DiffDroid and our experimental infrastructure are publicly available."
85,Charles,Lehman,,clehman31@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Master's,Hyperphasor Classification,"We have developed a novel method for the supervised training of pixel-wise classifiers that (i) offers a means for determining meaningful measure of confidence, (ii) incorporates the null class as a function of confidence of a classification as opposed to a positively labeled class, (iii) gives the flexibility to adjust classification thresholds that are independent of model training, (iv) has a low computational complexity and a high model efficiency, (v) provides robustness to course, in accurate, and missing labels, and (vi) boosts classification performance on label adjacency order permutations.  
Current state-of-the-art pixel-wise classification models utilize Cross-Entropy Loss (CEL) for optimization.  In cases where annotation of data is incomplete, a null class will be included in the set of classes for the model to classify.  The inclusion of a null class is desirable because it saves time during annotation of complex scenes.  However, when combined with CEL, the null class must be positively identified by the model, which we argue to be intractable.  The output of current state-of-the-art models is a softmax activation across all possible classes, which is often conveyed as a probability distribution and confidence due to the sum of all class predictions for a single pixel always adding to one.  However, this can only be used as a relative measure of confidence as the model is restricted in selection between a finite set for which the model is trained. Therefore, utilizing softmax activation as a measure of confidence of classification is misleading.  Our method addresses these issues."

Compared to their conventional counterparts, hybrid circuit breakers have the ability to limit the fault current, which allows more interconnections between substations, improving the grid reliability and resiliency. Furthermore, they enable the integration of distributed generation such as small solar power installations without expensive changes to the grid infrastructure. The proposed design of FMS operates in vacuum, carry high continuous current, open at current zero, feature minimum moving mass, and have an open contact separation of less than a millimeter, so the stresses experienced by its electrical contacts are different from that of conventional circuit breakers and vacuum interrupters. The poster expands on the research activities at Georgia Tech Plasma and Dielectrics Laboratory on the design of electrical contacts for FMS. This includes analysis to identify the most suitable material for electric contacts, as well as analysis and experimental results on the most suitable geometry of the electrical contacts. The contact material and geometry has a significant impact on the rating and durability of FMS."
87,Terese,Martinez,,tmmarti17@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Master's,Assisted Stent Insertion for the Treatment of Glaucoma,"For many decades,, the standard for surgical treatment of glaucoma has been trabeculectomy. While this method has been successful at reducing intraocular pressure (IOP), it also comes with the potential for many sight-threatening complications. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures reduce IOP with fewer risks. One such procedure is the implantation of subconjunctival stents, which increase the outflow of intraocular fluid in a controlled manner and bring intraocular pressure to normal levels. This method is immediately effective, allows for quicker patient recovery, and shorter operation times. Though there are numerous procedures used to insert such stents, this project focuses on one of the most commonly used and implemented methods which utilizes the Allergan® XEN Gel Stent and Injector. Our main goals for this project are to (i) understand the mechanism of stent insertion for surgical treatment of glaucoma, (ii) partially automate the procedure through a controlled actuation mechanism for the insertion procedure to improve efficacy and characterize the optimal motion required for an effective procedure, and (iii) create an illumination device that can be inserted and left inside the eye increasing the amount of light that is present within the anterior chamber throughout the duration of any optical surgery. The results from each of these objectives will provide not only useful data to characterize this particular treatment of glaucoma, but also remove the variability introduced by hand movements or tremors and inexperienced surgeons.

Acquisition and IPO are the major exit modes that offer liquidity and financial returns to both the external financers and entrepreneurs. Therefore, exit through acquisition and IPO are considered as a measure of success for high-tech startups. However, practitioners estimated that at least 80% of startups could have a better exit practice if the have a proper exit strategy at the founding stage. Currently, both researchers and entrepreneurs make exit decision based on firm performance and external economic and industry conditions at the exit time. In high-tech industries, the competitive advantage of high-tech startups comes from the application of technology. Though the commercialization process contains risks and uncertainty, many performances in the commercialization process are correlated to particular characteristics of the technology. In this project, I am using the novelty of technology to predict the potential exit mode of high-tech startups. This project found that startups with novel technology are associated with a higher chance of success exit through both IPO and acquisition. However, among startups with novel technology, when the technology also has the characteristic of conventionality, it is more likely to exit through acquisition compared to IPO. The result of this paper is useful for both entrepreneurs and investors to choose a better exit strategy for high-tech startups."

90,Hyung,Kim,,hkim664@gatech.edu,Architecture,Master's,Layering White Box,"Aging population and population growth are significant concerns for the healthcare system, especially in urban areas, as available resources are limited in terms of cost, healthcare specialists, and spaces. Crowding population in limited urban areas due to population growth has led to increases real estate prices that make it more difficult for aging population to afford. Also, increased cost of living in urban areas contribute to higher medical expenses, which makes it more difficult for patients to seek necessary medical attention. Despite these difficult situations, the health care system must find effective ways to care for patients' wellbeing. 

In urban health care setting, where resources and space are limited, it is difficult to provide optimal recovery environment for patients. Evidence-based design revealed that patients with windows to outside views had faster recovery rate than patients in a room without any windows. However, meeting that requirement in every facility may be difficult or impossible. Development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology in the recent years availed creating desired environments in limited spaces. Use of VR and AR can do more than creating a window with nature view but they can also be utilized to be therapeutic. VR and AR combined with evidence-based design may bring optimal recovery environments to patients with limited mobility."

By scaling down the devices, engineers designed smaller yet more powerful circuits and systems; nowadays, a common cellphone is more capable than the computers, used to do the calculations to send humans to the moon. However, this ever-growing trend is not sustainable; thus, engineers and physicists have invented novel technologies to replace and to augment the current CMOS electronics. One of the promising candidates is spintronics that works based on representing the digital binary logics, 0 and 1, using the spinning direction of electrons. Spin-based devices have fascinated engineers with their energy efficiency and fast operation. In this work, some potential candidates of novel spintronic devices are designed, analyzed, and benchmarked using the electronic circuit models, developed from the physics governing magnetic and piezoelectric materials."

The vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism enables the synthesis of semiconductor nanowires with different functional blocks encoded along their length. However, current substrate-based syntheses cannot offer the economically competitive scale-up needed for applications such as large-area electronics and solar energy harvesting. Nanowire growth inside porous hollow silica microspheres, by contrast, offers the advantage of 3D scaling and compatibility with standard fluidized bed reactors. The requisite hollow microspheres have a target size of 30 to 100 micrometers and gold catalyst nanoparticles exposed on their inner surface. We discuss in detail the steps and rationale of their preparation procedure, which involves (a) the emulsification of a moderately salty aqueous gold nanoparticle dispersion in an extractable organic solvent using partially hydrophobized silica particles as the emulsion stabilizer; (b) the addition of strongly hydrophobic silica particles to the continuous solvent phase; (c) re-emulsification in an aqueous solution of low ionic strength, yielding a w/o/w emulsion with multiple water droplets inside a typical solvent droplet; (d) osmotic swelling and coalescence of the inner water droplets resulting in double emulsion droplets with a single aqueous core, (e) solvent extraction to produce aqueous-core, solid-shell microsphere capsules dispersed in an aqueous medium, and (f) drying. Si nanowires grown inside the resulting hollow microspheres from SiH4 and Au catalyst nanoparticles are single crystalline and exhibit excellent morphologies."

During acute cellular rejection (ACR), host CD8 T cells damage allograft tissue by releasing the serine protease granzyme B (GzmB) to trigger donor cell death. To develop a noninvasive biomarker of early ACR, we engineer activity-based nanosensors to sense GzmB activity during rejection by producing an amplified signal in host urine for detection. These nanosensors comprise GzmB-specific peptide substrates conjugated to nanoparticles, preferentially accumulate in allograft and secondary lymphoid organs, and sense antigen-specific T cell killing. In a skin graft mouse model of transplant rejection, systemic administration of activity nanosensors result in significant elevation of urine signals at the onset of ACR before features of rejection appear in graft tissue. This approach is noninvasive and may allow routine monitoring of allograft immune health without the risk of a biopsy."

In this study, we investigated the ability of angular spectrum (AS) method, a fast planar projection method, to perform passive acoustic mapping of microbubbles through an intact skull. Finite-difference time-domain numerical simulations were used to model microbubble emissions' propagation through homogeneous, stratified, and 2D inhomogeneous (skull) environments approximately 80 mm by 160 mm. Reconstructions with the AS approach were performed with constant and effective sound speeds, as well as with multi-step and analytical propagation techniques, to evaluate their ability to correct for induced aberrations. We also investigated the impact of the receiver position on the localization accuracy. Results for skull simulations indicated that the multi-step AS method reduced the error in axial localization of the microbubbles by on the order of 50% compared with the effective sound speed method, while incurring approximately a 25% increase in computation time for each doubling of the number of propagation steps. Both AS methods were several orders of magnitude faster than time-domain reconstruction."
95,Sushruta,Surappa,,sushsurappa@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,A capacitive parametric ultrasonic transducer (CPUT) for wireless power transfer,"A capacitive ultrasonic transducer based on a parametric resonator structure is described and
experimentally demonstrated. The transducer structure, which we call capacitive parametric
ultrasonic transducer (CPUT), uses a parallel plate capacitor with a movable membrane as part of a degenerate parametric series RLC resonator circuit with a resonance frequency of fo. When the capacitor plate is driven with an incident harmonic ultrasonic wave at the pump frequency of 2fo with sufficient amplitude, the RLC circuit becomes unstable and ultrasonic energy can be efficiently converted to an electrical signal at fo frequency in the RLC circuit. An important characteristic of the CPUT is that unlike other electrostatic transducers, it does not require DC bias or permanent charging to be used as a receiver. We describe the operation of the CPUT using an analytical model and numerical simulations, which shows drive amplitude dependent operation regimes including parametric resonance when a certain threshold is exceeded. We verify these predictions by experiments with a micromachined membrane based capacitor structure in immersion where ultrasonic waves incident at 4.28 MHz parametrically drive a signal with significant amplitude in the 2.14 MHz RLC circuit. With its unique features, the CPUT can be particularly advantageous for applications such as wireless power transfer for biomedical implants and acoustic sensing."
96,Kyuman,Lee,,klee400@gatech.edu,Aerospace Engineering,Ph.D.,State and Parameter Estimation Using Measurements with Unknown Time Delay,"Standard Kalman filtering does not handle time-delayed measurements, and if the delay is significant, large estimation errors may accumulate over time. Furthermore, the delay value is typically unknown and variable in many real applications. To fuse measurements with unknown time delays, this study incorporates a parameter estimation technique into state estimation. In the combined parameter-state estimator, we directly estimate the delay value as an additional state and simultaneously obtain refined state estimates in the modified Kalman filter that compensates for delayed measurements. Since estimated delay value has some constraints, the estimator requires both interpolation and the truncation of the probability density function. Monte Carlo simulation results of this study show that this approach is more reliable than existing approaches for state estimation using measurements with unknown time delays."
97,Eric,Tervo,,eric.tervo@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Near-Field Radiative Thermoelectric Energy Converters,"Semiconductor p-n devices can utilize thermal radiation across a temperature difference to either produce electricity or provide refrigeration.  The classical example is a photovoltaic cell, which generates electricity from solar radiation.  A different hot object could also deliver the thermal radiation, and the p-n device is then termed a thermophotovoltaic cell.  If the p-n junction is hotter than its surroundings, it can produce electricity by emitting radiation and is called a thermoradiative cell.  If instead electricity is provided to the p-n device, it can either cool itself as an electroluminescent refrigerator or cool its surroundings as a negative electroluminescent refrigerator.  All four of these devices may achieve performance improvements by operating at micro or nanoscale separation distances from the hot or cold object with which they exchange thermal radiation.  In this situation, near-field effects can drastically increase the rate of energy exchange and cause thermal emission and absorption to be quasi-monochromatic.  Ultimately, this provides a pathway for improved device efficiencies and power densities.  This poster provides a summary of device operation as well as theoretical and experimental advances towards the realization of these near-field radiative thermoelectric energy converters."

It is relatively inexpensive and portable compared to other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT). Integrated circuits manifest a great impact on improving medical imaging technologies, where ultrasound plays a vital role in heart disease diagnosis although Coronary heart disease still kills more people than any other form of disease. Using capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUTs) can provide integration of supporting front-end circuitry and transducers to reduce the area and cost of preceding MUI bulky machines. Increasing demands for 3-dimension real-time ultrasound images highly encourages researchers to work on CMUT array although the complexity of the circuitry can make a limitation on improving resolution of ultrasound images. In addition, wireless power and data transmission can degrade these complexities while improves sensitivity. This work presents a reduced-wire integrated system that interfaces 16-channel CMUT array and uses time multiplexing to excite CMUT array in Tx and to send amplified converted-current-to-voltage serial data to back-end process unit for image reconstruction."

My research focuses on the evolution of targeted attacks against electricity infrastructure, from 1970 through present day, and how federal funding and policies react to improve grid resiliency and security. The research considers incidents caused by weather events, technical failures, targeted physical and cyberattacks to evaluate how the characteristics of the incidents affect policy interventions and funding allocation at the federal level. In particular, is there a difference in policy response when the incident is related to a confirmed or suspected attack versus a weather-related outage? Using data collected by the Department of Energy and Department of Homeland Security from 2000 to 2016, I explore whether the characteristics of an incident (a physical or cyberattack versus a weather or technical-caused outage) influences the budgetary response at the federal level. I investigate whether these improvements will actually help prevent and deter future attacks, especially as methods and motivations for attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Overall, this research can help better assess the metrics of attacks on electricity infrastructure in the U.S., the policy response, and explore further what vulnerable aspects might be left unaddressed and potential targets in more sophisticated future attacks."

Various researchers have developed algorithms utilizing Image segmentation and machine learning concepts to achieve automated counting. In this paper, Deep Learning is utilized along with a tracking algorithm to automate a passenger counting system. This model uses a Convolutional Neural Network based classifier along with a Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) detector for locating the position of a passenger in the frame. The detector is applied only on the frames which are classified as containing a human. Utilizing such a cascade facilitates real-time performance as the classifier is approximately 15 times faster than the detector. A tracking algorithm is used along with the CNN based classifier so as to provide both spatial and temporal detail for determining the direction of movement of the passenger. The proposed algorithm has a classification accuracy of 95.2% and a detection rate of 93.92% on a real-time video feed. Further the computation time required by the classifier was 0.027 seconds and the detector required 0.419 seconds, thereby providing real-time classification. These results were obtained by running the algorithm on a self -developed dataset acquired from a Georgia Tech Stinger Bus and the performance of this model was observed to be better than other pre-existing algorithms found in the literature."

In a recently introduced non-Abelian variant (arXiv:1702.08564), an SO(3) operator, carried by the spin-fluctuation tensor of a spin-1 system,  is identified as the geometric phase of loops on or inside the Bloch ball. The special class of loops inside the Bloch ball which pass through the center, which we refer to as \textit{singular loops}, is significant in two ways. First, their geometric phase is non-Abelian and second, their geometrical properties are qualitatively different from the nearby non-singular loops, making then akin to critical points of a quantum phase transition. Here we use coherent control of ultra cold Rubidium atoms in a dipole trap to experimentally explore the geometric phase of singular loops."

When loaded with a photoabsorber, PFCnDs can also provide photoacoustic (PA) contrast, as they will change phase from droplet to bubble when activated by a laser source. Utilizing this phase-changing behavior, we demonstrate the ability of laser-activated PFCnDs to open the blood brain barrier (BBB) and deliver an encapsulated photoabsorber across the BBB. This method of opening enables non-invasive delivery of contrast or therapeutics to the brain tissue and is visualized through US/PA imaging. To demonstrate the tool's effectiveness in vivo, laser energy was applied, and a co-injection of PFCnDs and Evan's Blue dye was employed to verify BBB opening in mice. Ex vivo US/PA imaging was performed to examine the ability of PFCnDs to deliver PA absorbing dye to the brain. Results demonstrate the ability of laser activated PFCnDs to open the BBB and deliver agents to the brain. Furthermore, these results show PFCnDs can enable localized and sufficient delivery of contrast agents for US/PA imaging. These studies provide insight into how laser activated PFCnDs can be harnessed for opening of the BBB and delivery of contrast agents and therapeutics. Additionally, delivery can be monitored via US/PA imaging due to the nature of both PFCnDs and the photoabsorber used to activate the droplets. As a result, laser-activated PFCnDs act as versatile agents for the brain, as they can be used for BBB opening, delivery, and US/PA imaging."

In this technique, the data bits are firstly modulated using ultrashort femtosecond optical pulses generated by mode-locked lasers, and then by employing a unique phase metamask for each data stream, in order to provide the multiple access capability, the optical signals are spectrally encoded. This procedure spreads the optical signal in the temporal domain and generates low-intensity pseudo-noise bursts through random phase coding leading to minimized multiple access interference. By controlling the interference between the provided Mie and Fabry-Perot resonance modes, we tailor the spectral and spatial responses of the impinging light locally and independently. Accordingly, we designed a MS-based grating with the highest possible refracted angle and, in the meantime, the maximized efficiency which results in a reasonable diameter for the subsequent lens. Moreover, our designed MS-based lens for the 4f correlator system commensurate with the spot size and distance requirements of the pursuant phase mask. This work can be regarded as a pioneering attempt to make a bridge between the recent tremendous advancement in the nonophotonics technology and that of optical communication networks to extend the boundaries and facilitate their effective miniaturized deployment highly appreciated in many novel applications such as the integrated lab-on-chip biosensing and highly-secured optical communications."
106,Ramy,Nashed,,r_nashed@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Accurate Determination of Interlayer Resistance of Multilayer Graphene,Multi-layer graphene (MLG) interconnects are expected to be a very promising candidate to replace conventional copper interconnects compared to Single Layer Graphene (SLG) because MLG provides more conduction paths compared to SLG and therefore has an overall lower resistance. This overall resistance highly depends on the interlayer resistance between the graphene layers and hence an accurate determination of this resistance is needed. In this work we propose an accurate method to determine the interlayer resistance as well as the sheet resistance of MLG grown by chemical vapor deposition. We also study the dependence of resistance on the number as well as the stacking sequence of graphene layers. This study solves the inconsistency of the previous research efforts that reported interlayer resistance values that varied by several orders of magnitude.

Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and Combinatorial Optimization (CO) are mathematical tools for modeling optimization problems that involve discrete decisions. Such optimization models are then solved with algorithms on computers. However, solving such problems is generally challenging, despite decades of advanced research. For instance, the branch-and-bound algorithm for solving MIP problems involves decisions that are currently addressed heuristically. Instead, we propose to use machine learning (ML) to make better-informed, input-specific decisions in MIP branch-and-bound. For branching and primal heuristic selection, our ML approaches significantly improve solver performance on heterogeneous MIPLIB instances and certain homogeneous families of instances. For some classical combinatorial problems, we propose a deep graph embedding framework for learning powerful greedy heuristics, and show that the learned heuristics are competitive with existing heuristics for VertexCover, MaxCut and Traveling Salesman Problem."

To circumvent this, one effort is to develop not-in-kind alternatives to vapor compression. We propose a flow battery inspired electrochemical heat pump that uses the entropic heat of reaction to cool a stream of water. The device uses a Galvanic cell and a Faradaic cell to drive electrolytes between two points along the reaction coordinate. Depending on the temperature coefficient of the electrochemical reactions involved, the Galvanic and Faradaic cell reactions are either exothermic or endothermic. The electrolytes then pass through two heat exchangers that allow the electrolyte to heat or cool two water streams.

Two different semiconducting polymers, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT), can be spontaneously co-assembled with fungal proteins known as hydrophobins into dendritic, crystalline structures via evaporation-induced self-assembly. 

Traditional evaporative methods such as dropcasting result in coffee-ring like structures due to surface tension gradients. To ensure more uniform coverage, surface-active, fungal proteins are added, which serves to (1) inhibit mass transfer of polymer to the edges of the drop by changing air-liquid surface tensions and (2) encapsulate polymer into dendritic architectures during the drying process. This facile technique also enables formation of supramolecular assemblies without additional side-chain modification of these polymers.  

In contrast to large-area coating techniques such as blade coating and gravure printing, dropcasting can be extended to inkjet printing. A mixture of fungal protein and polymer can be dispensed and evaporated into desired 1D patterns on substrates, which can be then utilized for numerous electronic applications."

An important question for policy is whether this model of niche experimentation is optimal for disrupting entrenched fossil fuel based systems. Within our own community, the planned construction of the Living Building at Georgia Tech, a cutting edge, environmentally-friendly research and education facility, is a prime example of localized experimentation with niche building technologies and practices to address the campus' impact on local ecological and environmental systems. There are some private benefits of construction that accrue to the campus community in the form of reduced operational expenses, productivity improvements among building occupants, or by gaining notoriety as a leader in sustainable building practices. However, the Living Building may also confer benefits to others outside the campus community who are not directly invested in the project. In this paper, I ask whether experimentation with green building technologies confers positive externalities to non-participants. To answer this question, I study the effect of experimentation on organizational learning within the context of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) pilot program. The empirical methodology in my analysis is stylized after models of contagion commonly found in the epidemiology literature. The main results of the analysis suggest successfully piloted technologies induce outside organizations to experiment with these technologies and assimilate niche technologies within the organization's building network."

However, the performance of a zinc electrode is limited by passivation, shape change, and dendrite growth. We proposed a novel Zn anode, three-dimensional carbon paper (current collector) zinc oxide @ titanium nitride core/shell nanorods (denoted as 3D CP ZnO@TiN core/shell NRs) in coin cell, which solved three above problems. Such a design has multiple advantages: (1) ZnO nanoarrays minimizes the anode passivation and enhances the utilization of anode; (2) there is no dendrite problem due to 3D nanostructure of CP ZnO@TiN core/shell NRs; (3) the 3D CP framework and TiN coating, which encapsulates ZnO NRs, function as an electrical pathway so that all ZnO NRs are electrochemically active; (4) the TiN coating enables fast hydroxide/water diffusion as well as efficiently blocks zincates; (5) the TiN coating serves as mechanical backbone, which prevent anode structure fracture and shape change. As a result, 3D CP ZnO@TiN core/shell NRs anode achieves superior reversible performance compared with uncoated CP ZnO NRs. It delivers excellent long-term electrochemical performance as cycled under start-stop conditions.  We use coin cells for research, which are small, fast and easy to assemble yet rarely used for rechargeable Zn-Ni batteries. Our research makes it possible to bring rechargeable Zn-Ni coin cells to the market."

While organized by DARPA, competitions involved hundreds of participants, including representatives from universities, startups, large companies, and other government agencies. This study explores the genesis and evolution of the program from 2004 through 2007, as well as its subsequent impact. It does so through inductive interviews with program architects and organizers, challenge participants, policy experts, as well as representatives from industry currently developing derivative applications. The study finds that the program not only accelerated the development of specific enabling technologies, it also promoted the integration of these technologies onto specific platforms. In so doing, the program met its mission objectives and provided the foundation for a new automated vehicle industry. Implications for the conceptualization of innovation prizes and policy are discussed."

However, it is difficult to parse out how different genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors impact the healthspan and overall lifespan of individuals. Caenorhabditis elegan (C. elegans) is a small nematode ideal for aging studies due to a high degree of genetic homology with humans, ease of genetic manipulation, and a short lifespan; however, conventional methods for long-term, longitudinal aging studies are low-throughput, labor intensive, and difficult to perform. We have developed a robust, high-throughput microfluidic-based platform that enables us to perform long-term, longitudinal culturing of individual C. elegans for their entire adult lifespan. It automatically captures behavior throughout the entire adult lifespan, allowing us to observe health and aging phenotypes over time, and it provides spatial and temporal environmental control. We demonstrate the platform's versatility and robustness by examining the impact of different genetic mutations, culture temperatures, and dietary conditions on the healthspan and lifespan of the worms. We are also able to examine individual variability within a population, giving us insights into the role of stochasticity in aging."

Our rectenna devices incorporate ultrafast metal-insulator-metal tunneling diodes fabricated on the tips of CNT antennas arrays to convert high-frequency electromagnetic waves to D.C. electricity. The tunneling barrier geometry and insulator material selection are critical to designing high performance CNT diodes. We demonstrate new CNT diode structures that incorporates multiple insulating layers to control electron tunneling and achieve incredible current-voltage asymmetry (>100) with air stable metal contacts. We also report improved antenna-diode impedance matching by etching open the multiwall tips to increase contacts with inner walls, and also by manipulating the tunneling barrier width and height, altogether lowering resistance by several orders of magnitude. Our multi-insulator devices show the first evidence of air stable rectification under IR and visible laser illumination, with efficiency of 10-5%. The open-circuit voltage is as high as -150 mV, several orders of magnitude higher than previous rectenna reports and now in the practical range for photodetection. These results bring to light a new generation of CNT rectenna array with improved designs and that can use a variety of top electrode materials â  air stable, transparent, and conductive materials indicating strong potential and efficient utilization in a variety of high-frequency applications."
116,Georges,Pavlidis,,gpavlidis3@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Assessing the performance and reliability of Gallium Nitride based electronics via optical and electrical methods,"Gallium nitride (GaN) based electronics have shown great potential for Radio Frequency (RF) devices and power electronics. Its superior material properties have enabled the fabrication of high frequency and high voltage devices. At high power conditions, significant localized heating occurs and can have detrimental effects on the device performance. The quantification of performance parameters such as the gate junction temperature is thus necessary to accurately assess the device's quality and lifetime. Until now Raman thermometry has shown to be the most accurate method to estimate the junction temperature. This method, however, is limited to a point measurement and sometimes may be limited by its optical access. Furthermore, the ability to monitor the transient temperature rise under pulsed conditions has not been yet fully developed. The proposed work aims to develop a method that provides an in-situ transient temperature measurements and temperature mappings across GaN based electronics. A combination of experimental, analytical and numerical analysis is proposed to achieve this. The potential application of the proposed work is discussed and initial results are shown for thermal characterization of lateral HEMTs, vertical PIN diodes and cross sectional HEMTs. The limitations of the current techniques are discussed and contrasted with the proposed method."

It could enable more massive payloads to be launched from Earth to deep space, significantly increasing access for scientific and industrial space applications on at the Moon, Mars, and beyond. My team convinced the jury - NASA JPL, Airbus, Microsoft, Keck Institute for Space Studies “ that our concept was a technically feasible and economically viable. The Lunar Extraction for Extraterrestrial Prospecting, LEEP, design was shaped within a proposed budget of 1 billion dollars a year. LEEP's proposal incorporates high Technology Readiness Level, TRL, systems and a highly robust, modular, fault-tolerant design to produce propellant for deep space missions at the lunar South Pole on a short time scale and with a low risk of mission failure. Nominal operating capacity is expected in the late 2020s; LEEP can resupply one mission to Mars per year, enabling a 27.6% increase in payload delivered to Mars. The modular architecture could be expanded in the future to enable multiple missions per year and only for a fraction of the cost of the initial system. Early numbers indicate a 250% increase in payload delivered directly to a Saturn compared to a mission that is not refueled. This has direct applications for robotic exploration of the outer Solar System and for vastly expanded mission capabilities at very little additional cost."

Computational models have emerged as effective in-silico tools (apart from in-vitro and in-vivo technique) to enhance the understanding of the NP delivery mechanisms and guide the rational design of novel NP configurations. Recently, a parallel in-silico solver has been developed to enable fast direct numerical simulation (FDNS) of multiscale and multicomponent cellular blood flow with high efficiency. This solver comprehensively integrates the lattice-Boltzmann (LB) technique for the plasma, the spectrin-link (SL) method for the red blood cell (RBC) and a newly developed Langevin-dynamics (LD) approach for nanoscale particles/proteins. Computational techniques such as linearly scalable search algorithm and hybrid parallelism have been applied to realize high-performance computing.

119,Varun Amar,Reddy,,varun.reddy@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Energy-Efficient Network Architecture for Seismic Data Acquisition via Wireless Geophones,"The demand for oil, gas, and minerals is an ever-growing one, as they are absolutely necessary for the sustenance of global economy. Over the years, seismic surveys have grown in area and density, and continue to do so. This calls for new and innovative techniques for seismic data monitoring  and acquisition. Traditional seismic data acquisition systems rely on telemetry cables and geophones, whose deployment and maintenance costs are increasing substantially as surveys become larger and denser. A significant amount of time is spent in troubleshooting problems pertaining to the cables and connectors. Laying down cables in an undulated environment is a challenging task, where large shrubs, trees, and rocks become difficult obstacles to overcome, and can also negatively impact the ecosystem. The use of a wireless geophone network not only eliminates the above problems, but is also more cost-effective, as there is lesser labor work required. A novel wireless geophone network architecture is proposed, which makes use of the IEEE 802.11af standard. It offers a significantly higher transmission range, by operating in the TV White Space at lower frequencies, which is available for unlicensed use. A novel data collection application, called the Geophone-Polling (GP) scheme, is also developed, which outperforms the default 802.11af standard in terms of data collection rate and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed GP scheme is open, as no changes are made to the 802.11af firmware. This eliminates the costs associated with using expensive licensed products, thereby reducing the overall expense incurred by seismic exploration companies."
120,Anthony,Harding,,tony.harding@gatech.edu,Economics,Ph.D.,Quantitative Evaluation of Non-cooperative vs. Cooperative Abatement Equilibria Using Countries' Social Cost of Carbon,"Climate change is frequently framed as a public good problem where countries fail to cooperate in abatement goals. This issue is attributed to free-riding because small shares of global benefits are outweighed by high abatement costs. Theoretical methods to encourage cooperation have been proposed, and using a novel dataset for the social cost of carbon with an unprecedented spatial resolution for 169 countries and estimated marginal abatement cost curves we perform initial quantitative evaluations. We first examine how close countries are to the non-cooperative Nash Equilibrium and find that current mitigation efforts are far below this equilibrium. Countries are not internalizing their social costs of carbon as economic theory would suggest. Shifting to this Nash Equilibrium would increase global abatement efforts by 6.5 billion tCO2 by 2020. Examining Weitzman's (2016) world climate assembly where every country votes on a uniform per-unit carbon price, we estimate a price of $627/tCO2. This is closer to the optimal price of $449/tCO2 compared to an average price of $2.66/tCO2 in the Nash equilibrium, but the assumption that every country works together and adheres to the final price is unrealistic. Relaxing this assumption to allow for the endogenous formation of a climate assembly, we find several stable coalitions; however, abatement efforts only increase by around 1% over the Nash Equilibrium. These results suggest that focusing climate policy on getting countries to internalize their own social cost of carbon will have a similar impact as feasible cooperative outcomes while being easier to achieve."
121,Sampath,Kommandur,,ksampath.1990@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Anisotropic thermal characterization in polymer films and nanowires,"The growing use of polymer thermoelectrics and photovoltaics in the recent past has accelerated the need to develop efficient polymeric materials and fundamentally understand the underlying physics in polymers. Thermal transport in these thin film geometries are usually anisotropic and this anisotropy could directly influence the performance of the device. Therefore, accurate measurement of the anisotropic thermal properties is key to understanding transport mechanisms in polymers, and in developing high-performing devices. Low thermal conductivity of polymers makes it a challenge for accurate characterization. In this work, an electro-thermal measurement technique called 3-Omega is modified to accurately measure anisotropic thermal conductivity of suspended polymer films. A simplified 1-D model can be used to obtain the desired material properties, and the sufficient conditions for the validity of this model are explored. With these sufficient conditions, it is possible to eliminate the need for complex photolithography techniques, which are often detrimental to polymers. With this measurement technique, anisotropic thermal properties can be measured within 10% of the exact value. The 3-Omega technique can also be extended to polymer fibers and nanowires with appropriate modifications. Nanostructured materials are another focus of the thermoelectric research community due to its unique thermophysical properties. Accurate measurement is required to explore the relatively niche area of thermal transport in nanowires, and a platform to measure thermal conductivity along the wire is developed as part of this work. The measurement platform can also be used to study interesting effects such as thermal rectification."

This work presents an advanced small-scale, in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) fatigue testing technique to characterize the fatigue behavior of Ni microbeams subjected to high/very high cycle fatigue loading conditions. The fatigue devices consist of MEMS microresonators that are driven at resonance inside the SEM, leading to fully-reversed loading of the microbeams at a frequency of ~8 kHz. The fatigue damage leads to a decrease of the microresonator's resonance frequency and is measured as a metric to quantify the crack growth rates. The in situ SEM observations also promote a direct evaluation of fatigue crack nucleation and propagation rates. In addition, the combination of this technique with focused ion beam (FIB) cross sectioning allows for a better understanding of the mechanisms of crack nucleation and propagation.

The stress-life fatigue curve obtained inside the SEM highlights over three orders of magnitude increase in fatigue life with respect to the fatigue curve obtained in air. The average crack propagation rates on the surface of the microbeam are extremely low and of the order of 10^(-12) m/cycle in air and 10^(-14) m/cycle in vacuum. We attribute such slow rates to a delay in the nucleation of voids underneath fatigue extrusions, which precedes the propagation of sharp cracks in-between voids. A larger number of voids were found in air compared to vacuum, which explains the higher propagation rates and life reduction in air."

124,Jingdao,Chen,,jchen490@gatech.edu,Robotics,Ph.D.,Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation and Object Recognition for Construction Applications,"The demand for construction site automation with mobile robots is increasing due to its advantages in cost-saving, productivity, and safety. To be realistically deployed on construction sites, mobile robots must be able to navigate in unstructured and cluttered environments. Furthermore, mobile robots should recognize both static and dynamic obstacles to determine drivable paths. However, existing technology is not suitable for construction applications due to the challenging environment on construction sites. This study introduces an autonomous as-is 3D spatial data collection and perception method for mobile robots specifically aimed for construction job sites with many spatial uncertainties. The proposed Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-based navigation and object recognition methods were implemented and tested with a custom-designed mobile robot platform, Ground Robot for Mapping Infrastructure (GRoMI), which uses multiple laser scanners and a camera to sense and build a 3D environment map. Given the reconstructed 3D map, a vector field algorithm was developed for autonomous navigation in an unknown environment with obstacles. Machine learning techniques were used to train classifiers for workers, vehicles and construction equipment based on a library of mesh models. The trained classifiers were used to recognize spatiotemporal obstacles to avoid in real time. To evaluate the quality of 3D point clouds generated by GRoMI, a survey-level laser scan was conducted, and their accuracies were compared. Overall, the generated point-cloud maps were sufficiently accurate to be used for many construction management applications such as construction progress monitoring, safety hazard identification, defect detection, and material inventory management."

In particular, supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) is an attractive working fluid to enhance the heat-to-power conversion efficiencies at such high temperatures. One of the major challenges to overcome in the process is; efficient transfer of heat from the heat source to sCO2 at high pressures (>20MPa) and temperatures (>750C). Under such extreme temperatures, the strength of the metallic alloys reduces dramatically leading to failure of the heat exchanger used to transfer the heat. The goal of this project is to fabricate and demonstrate the operation of a robust, compact, cost-effective cermet heat exchanger which can withstand such extreme operating conditions. This key technological advancement can enhance the heat-to-power conversion efficiencies (>50%) and on a broader scope enable higher penetration of renewable energy into the market by lowering the cost of electricity from concentrated solar power plant to"
126,Shivesh,Chaudhary,,schaudhary9@gatech.edu,Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,Ph.D.,Automatic tracking and annotation of neurons in pan-neuronal activity videos of behaving C. elegans.,"High throughput imaging capabilities of microfluidics combined with advanced microscopic techniques have enabled fast collection whole-brain functional recordings of C. elegans. However, processing time of these videos still limits the generation of important neuroscience insights. Accurately tracking neurons in videos is especially difficult due to large head deformations in moving animals. Manual annotation of neuron identity in each frame is also very slow and requires expert supervision.
Here we present an algorithm for automatic tracking and annotation of neurons in whole-brain videos. Our algorithm tracks multiple frames in one step by simultaneous non-rigid registration of frames. Consistency of tracks is ensured by including spatial and temporal features in Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based labelling framework. Thus our algorithm performs global optimization to generate tracks while still maintaining temporal consistency of tracks unlike locally optimal sequential tracking methods. Further, CRF framework can encode non-independent and higher order contextual features for tracking unlike generative models such as Hidden Markov Models (Kalman Filter). Thus, our method generalizes many cost optimization methods for tracking.
For automatic annotation, we developed a probabilistic graphical model that encodes known spatial relationships among neurons as node and edge features. Our model infers probability distribution over identities of all neurons in whole-brain videos from the known identities of a sparse subset. Thus it provides a confidence estimate of the true identities. These tools should improve the processing speed of pan-neuronal activity recordings of C. elegans and will help in fully utilizing the large amount of data being collected."
127,Brandon,Sharp,,brandon.sharp@gatech.edu,Chemistry and Biochemistry,Ph.D.,Structural Effects on the Performance of Negative Tone Photoresists,"Molecular resists offer several potential advantages to currently-used polymeric resists in the semiconductor industry. We have previously reported TPOE-3Ep, a negative-tone, epoxide-containing molecular resist, that was designed to contain a single phenol in order to provide an epoxy-based resist that is soluble in standard 0.26N TMAH developer. TPOE-3Ep resolved 26nm lines under EUV exposure, but delamination of patterned features at low doses in TMAH development and insoluble material in nominally unexposed regions at high doses prevented resolution of smaller features.

This poster will discuss the results of varying the ratio of epoxides and phenols on several different resists in an effort to identify an optimal ratio between the two functional groups that maintains TMAH solubiliaty until network formation is nearly complete to produce mechanically-robust features without suffering from bridging between patterned lines. DUV contrast curves will be used to probe the effect of altering this ratio on network conversion by comparing TMAH and organic solvent development conditions. By introducing more phenols into the resists, the glass transition of the materials will likely increase, and the effects of this change on patterning performance will also be discussed. 100 keV e-beam patterned lines of these materials will be presented as a final figure of merit of these new materials."

Since the current spectrum is inadequate to support this demand, the abundance of spectrum bandwidth in millimeter wave frequency band is expected to bolster an increase in capacity.
However, practical experimentation of the spectrum shows that it is prone to high propagation loss. To mitigate such losses, large number of antenna elements are employed to form narrow beams with high gain. Though effective in tackling losses, narrow beams introduce other challenges such as beam misalignment between the access point and mobile users in the neighbor discovery process. This may result in errors and consequently, missed detection.
This work focuses on beam sensing, alignment and discovery in millimeter wave communication. An increase in capacity should be accompanied by low latency is identifying neighboring nodes by a transmitter. To this end, we propose modified Auxiliary Beam Pair (mABP) for angular estimation of mobile users. We employ non-overlapping main beam lobes for the construction of beam pairs in millimeter wave communication. mABP achieves a better angular estimation within a short period than any other method proposed for user discovery. Also, the performance of beam pairs for millimeter wave communication in a noisy environment is considered for the first time. Again, mABP performed better when compared to other schemes."

However, studies have shown that self-report is unreliable as responses are impacted by stigma and memory lapses. Ultimately, veterans and the clinicians who treat them receive an incomplete picture of veteran's progress during treatment.

We introduce a novel technology, collective sensing, to create a more holistic picture for veterans and clinicians as veterans progress through treatment for PTSD. Collective sensing is a mobile technology which leverages feedback from the individual veteran as well as members of their social network to gather timely information regarding targeted behaviors via intelligent ecological momentary assessments (EMAs).

Our most recent studies have taken a two-fold approach to creating an effective system. First, we have built an accurate and power-efficient system using machine learning and proximity sensing. Second, we have examined how this technology can be deployed in the mental health sphere to provide clinicians and veterans with PTSD with greater visibility in treatment progression. Through 30 interviews with clinicians, veterans, and potential informants (friends/family of veterans), we have determined user-requirements and contextual factors necessary for a successful system.

Though our initial research emphasizes the use of collective sensing in the context of mental health, we envision deployment a variety of other settings where timely qualitative data is not readily available but desired including retail and personnel performance evaluation."

Here, we investigate the dynamical properties of the triangular-lattice spin-1/2 antiferromagnet Ba3CoSb2O9 in its 1/3 magnetization plateau phase using a combination of nonlinear spin-wave theory and neutron scattering measurements. The excellent agreement between our theoretical treatment and the experimental data demonstrates that magnons behave semiclassically in the plateau in spite of the purely quantum origin of the underlying magnetic structure. This allows for a quantitative determination of Ba3CoSb2O9 exchange parameters and also clarify the exotic nature of the zero-field spin excitations observed in the same material."

To meet the ever-increasing demand for high speed data processing and communication, modern electronics hardware and software have been combined to come up with devices capable of fast switching speeds. However, the achievable maximum switching speed in electronics has reached its intrinsic limitations. For this reason, fundamentally new approaches should be practiced to deliver more modern and efficient high-speed devices. An all-optical modulation scheme• switching the properties of light with light• has triggered a promising hope for the delivery of ultrafast modulation speeds way beyond that of the state-of-the art in electronics. In such a switching scheme, optical properties of resonant cavities (i.e., data) are manipulated via another beam of light (i.e., the switch) in an all-optical fashion. 

Here, we experimental demonstrate an all-optical plasmonic modulator capable of femtosecond (~ 190 fs) switching speeds that is a world record in such systems. Utilizing a plasmonic metalattice made of an array of sub-wavelength gold (Au) nanocubes, in this study, we show that optical data (i.e., plasmonic resonances) can be modulated via an ultrashort laser pulse (i.e., the switch). The proposed modulation scheme can be adopted to varieties of optical platforms without technological and design obstacles. Our results set a new benchmark for future metal-based plasmonic all-optical data processors with a miniaturized footprint."
132,Sun Hye,Kim,,skim3061@gatech.edu,Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering,Ph.D.,Data-driven Optimization via Machine Learning,"Many real-life engineering problems require complex and computationally expensive simulations. To optimize such problems, a function derivative is required; however, function derivatives are usually not available or time consuming to obtain, which makes optimization more difficult. One way of circumventing this problem is by constructing approximation models known as surrogate functions, which approximate the input-output relationship of the simulation while being computationally cheaper to evaluate. However, commonly used surrogate algorithms, such as Kriging and radial basis functions, usually lead to complicated equations that are not desirable when the function has to be optimized [2]. 

Therefore, the motivation of this work is to develop a low-complexity surrogate model via support vector machines (SVM). SVM has gained wide attention in machine learning due to its success in feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and data regression [1]. Using SVM, a surrogate model is built by choosing a best subset of terms among a large number of possible basis function sets. The surrogate model is then optimized and systematically improved using an optimization algorithm, ARGONAUT, which adaptively improves the model by narrowing the search region and finds a near-optimal point [3]. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed methodology was compared with a variety of other machine learning techniques, such as ALAMO and LASSO.

133,Sebastian,Ruf,,ruf@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Herding Complex Networks,"The problem of controlling complex networks is of fundamental interest to disciplines ranging from biology to robotics, serving as an important test of the understanding of the behavior of the dynamics that evolve over complex networks. Controlling a network is often addressed via the control theoretic notion of complete controllability. However there are cases where a system need not be completely controllable to achieve desirable system outcomes. In this poster, a network control notion known as herdability is introduced to study systems that are not completely controllable but for which certain desirable control outcomes are still achievable. Consider the following example: the task is to encourage some beneficial activity, like exercising, over a large social network. Controllability of the opinion dynamic would imply that all agents in the social network could be encouraged to hold a specific opinion, which can be different from that of their network neighbors. Herdability instead asks that all agents can be encouraged to have a high opinion; in this case, high enough that the activity is adopted. This poster considers implications of the notion of herdability for the study of complex networks."
134,Euisun,Kim,,ekim329@gatech.edu,Mechanical Engineering,Ph.D.,Assessment of Robot Necessity in Time Interval Dependent Rehabilitation Therapy,"Repeated movements or repeatedly applied stimulation are known to reorganize the motor cortex. For example, practicing playing the piano builds a strong connection between the neurons in the motor cortex area that takes care of piano play and make you a skillful pianist. In a similar manner, applying an external stimulation can improve motor function of individuals with motor dysfunctionality. Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) and repetitive facilitation exercise (RFE) is one of the well known physical therapies that apply two stimulations repeatedly to a subject.  Multiple stroke rehabilitation therapies, including paired associative stimulation(PAS) and repetitive facilitation exercises (RFE), rely on strict timing between peripheral and central stimulation to obtain a good rehabilitative result. Therefore one can expect motor function recovery when two stimulations are applying at the right time interval between two.
Current RFE protocols rely only on a therapist to determine and provide the timing for these stimulations and this could possibly degrade the quality of the rehabilitation intervention by applying two stimulations with variable time intervals. This work investigates the need for robotic assistance, as well as the nature of variable time interval production in human."

Its unique properties such as high strength and low density, making it appealing to many industry applications. Nevertheless, one of the most urgent issues that needs to be addressed is the lack of standardized, rapid and reliable characterization methods to achieve quality control for these nanomaterials. Rheology provides a fast and cost-effective way to characterize nanocellulose. Understanding the relationships between nanocellulose's intrinsic properties and its rheological behaviors will lay a solid foundation for establishment of testing standards.

In this work, we will show how rheological properties are influenced by concentration, temperature, salt content, and sample preparation methods. Several rheological testing protocols were performed.  Shear viscosity tests were carried out with three intervals to quantify thixotropy as well as viscosity. Parallel-plate, cone-plate and Couette geometries were explored to understand the variability in reported literature data for nanocellulose rheology. By varying temperature and salt concentration, new insights were obtained about the nature of interactions between nanocellulose particles in suspension and these tests provide excellent opportunities for quality control. Oscillatory rheology and recovery tests were performed to investigate gel forming dynamics in nanocellulose suspensions and correlated with polarized microscopy, which quantified phase behaviors. The experimental rheological data was fitted to rheological models to establish benchmarks for cellulose materials."

Two recently studied co-assembling pairs, CATCH(4+)/CATCH(6-) peptides developed by Hudalla and KW(+)/KW(-) peptides designed by King and Webb, have been shown to co-assemble into nanofibers upon mixing of the complementary peptide solutions, but individually, remain as random coils in solution. Prior structural analysis suggest that both peptide systems form antiparallel Î²-sheets using Thioflavin T fluorimetry, circular dichroism, and FTIR spectroscopy. Though these studies provide some structural information, these techniques are unable to resolve the specific 3D arrangement of the complementary peptide components within nanofibers necessitating further structural analysis by solid-state NMR (ssNMR) to develop an all-atom model. Here, we have adapted solid-state NMR techniques, previously used to characterize self-assembling peptides, to measure specific structural constraints with high-resolution in co-assembling peptide systems. Specifically, we have isotopically labeled with 13C and 15N select amino acids in KingWebb nanofiber samples and performed 2D ssNMR and dipolar recoupling measurements. Our 2D Dipolar-Assisted Rotational Recoupling (DARR) and dipolar recoupling measurements results suggest that both antiparallel and parallel Î²-sheets exist. We also present a series of PITHIRDS-CT measurements with isotopic dilution wherein we vary the isotopically labeled:unlabeled peptide ratio to evaluate the propensity for a peptide to interact with itself or its complementary peptide in a nanofiber sample. Preliminary PITHIRDS-CT measurements show that the CATCH(4+) and CATCH(6-) peptides have a mixture of like and complementary neighbors."
137,Wencheng,Jin,,wencheng.jin@gatech.edu,Civil Engineering,Ph.D.,Micro-macro fracture propagation using XFEM,"The fundamental failure mechanism of quasi-brittle materials is a continuum process including: (1) diffused micro crack inception and growth, (2) localized macro fracture formation due to micro cracks coalescence. Current numerical tools can be grouped into two categories: (1) The Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) models can phenomenologically simulate the stiffness reduction due to micro crack evolution, however, they cannot represent the discontinuous displacement; (2) In contrast, the cohesive zone models can explicitly calculate the topology of macro fracture paths, but they ignore the initiation and growth of micro cracks. To overcome these limitations, we propose to couple an anisotropic damage model with a cohesive zone model using eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM). Grounded on micromechanics, the anisotropic damage model simulates micro crack density explicitly, and the integral type nonlocal enhancement is used to avoid mesh dependence. Once the diffused crack density in regular finite elements exceeds a critical value, we split the element and insert a cohesive zone segment to represent the macro fracture formation using XFEM technique. The critical crack density, above which cracks interact, is determined by comparing the damaged elastic moduli predicted by the proposed nonlocal CDM model, which does not account for crack interaction, with those predicted with Kachanov's micromechanical model, which accounts for crack interaction. The cohesive strength and energy release rate of the cohesive zone segment are assigned in a way that the total dissipated energy, including the micro crack evolution and macro fracture formation, is constant. 3-point bending and wedge splitting tests are simulated, and results show that the proposed framework has excellent predictions."

Replacing flammable organic liquid electrolytes with nonflammable inorganic solid alternatives can potentially eliminate these safety concerns. On the other hand, low-cost electrochemical energy storage technologies beyond lithium chemistry are also highly desired for large-scale applications. All-solid-state Na ion batteries are one of the promising candidates for grid-level energy storage owing to their low cost and outstanding safety properties. The key enabler of this technology is a suitable solid electrolyte with sufficiently high ionic conductivity at room temperature and good electrochemical stability. This work presents a group of novel sodium superionic conductors to address the foregoing issues, which is a topic currently receiving extensive attention in the field of electrochemistry and energy storage.
Through a rational design approach and using facile solid-state reactions, we obtained a series of novel Na3SbSe4-xSx compounds. Na3SbSe4 shows a room temperature conductivity of 0.85 mS/cm, which is among the highest values reported to date. The conductivities and diffusion activation energies of this series of compounds show interesting trends, which provides insightful structure-property relationships for the Na-ion conductors. An all-solid-state Na-ion battery cell with these compounds as electrolyte was successfully assembled and cycled at room temperature. We believe these results demonstrate the promise of this group of chalcogenide-based compounds as solid electrolytes and will provide insights for further studies in Na ion conductors and solid-state batteries."

When it comes to alternative delivery programs, the challenge becomes more apparent as a unique set of project management and leadership skills are required to perform design's build services. These skills often require project-related experience in alternative project delivery. Considering the evolving nature of innovative delivery methods, state DOTs are challenged with keeping up with changes in the required workforces and skillsets for design's build programs. State DOTs need to understand the new roles and positions that the office of innovative delivery might be responsible for and it is also necessary for them to identify best practices in procurement of consulting resources (e.g., types of programmatic agreements used by state DOTs as a means to deal with increased workload). The purpose of this study is to identify and address the existing challenges and practices in organizational structuring and professional staffing of the innovative delivery units in several state DOTs across the nation that are actively utilizing alternative project delivery. The specific research objectives are (1) identifying and analyze major challenges and barriers faced by innovative project delivery units to fulfill project leadership staffing needs and (2) identifying strategies to enhance professional staffing of innovative delivery program. A structured and consistent interview and survey distribution process was conducted to collect information form subject matter experts in various DOTs. Then a following comprehensive content analysis on collected documents and contracts from DOTs was conducted to identify various approaches that state DOTs have utilized to respond to their staffing and organizational needs. Differences in organizational structuring and professional staffing for innovative project delivery programs are described in these following areas: (a) Models of office of innovative delivery; (b) Main roles and responsibilities of the headquarters (HQ) office of innovative delivery; (c) Involvement of district offices in delivery of design build projects; (d) Training and staffing strategies and preferred skillsets; and (e) Utilizing consulting firms to assist the owner. The outcome of this study can help state DOTs and consulting companies to strengthen the design's build workforce inside the state DOTs and identify different practices."

The performance of thermosiphon bushings was analyzed by a finite element model, and validated by experiments. Various geometries, conductor materials, working fluids, and filling ratios have been compared and measured as a function of heat load. Compared to  traditional copper bushings where the thermal conductivity is limited to approximately 400 W/(mÎ‡K), a thermosiphon bushing has significantly higher equivalent thermal conductivity: It could be demonstrated that a 12.7-mm diameter thermosiphon bushing has thermal conductivity of 6680 W/(mÎ‡K) at heat load of 150 W. Thermosiphon bushings combine exceptionally high power density, maintenance-free operation, long life-expectancy, and applicability under a wide range of working conditions. All these advantages show the potential of thermosiphon bushings to be a universal, low-cost, thermal management device for high-current rated power equipment, where high power density is essential."
142,Siddharth,Mayya,Magnus Egerstedt,siddharth.mayya@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,Enabling Ant-Like Behaviors in Multi-Robot Systems Using Inter-Robot Collisions as a Sensing Modality,"Collision avoidance constitutes one of the key mechanisms for making multi-robot systems operate in a safe and orderly manner. This certainly makes a lot of sense in a number of applications, where collisions have the potential to be catastrophic, e.g., for fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles or platoons of self-driving trucks. However, as the spatial scale of robots decrease in multi-robot systems, collisions cease to be catastrophic events that need to be avoided at all costs. This implies that less conservative, coordinated control strategies can be employed, where collisions between robots can be tolerated. Moreover, once one embraces the somewhat unorthodox position that robots are allowed to collide, one can observe that there is actual information to be extracted from the collisions. For example, if a robot collides frequently with other robots, it should be able to infer something about the robot density. This phenomenon has been observed frequently in biological systems, where swarming animals use collisions with their neighbors to obtain information about their surroundings. In particular, it has been shown that ant colonies use physical contact with other ants as a sensory mechanism to perform various useful tasks such as predator avoidance, foraging, and traffic regulation. We follow this line of inquiry by employing collisions as a sensing modality that provides information about the robots' surroundings, and demonstrate that this information can be used by the robots to perform useful tasks like traffic regulation and localization."

Residential housing market alone, has a significant impact on U.S. emissions. Residential retrofits have been identified as a key solution to reduce building energy consumption, without consuming a large portion of upfront embodied energy and generating consequential embodied carbon for a new building construction. While increasing home energy efficiency is a national goal, there has been only limited number of homeowners who accept to pursue comprehensive home energy improvements. Even if accepted, it is often done in a single measure implementation approach. 
The objective of this research is to study residential buildings built over years in city of Atlanta and conduct comprehensive energy, cost and carbon emission retrofit optimization analysis over potential mix of improvements and technologies. The goal is to find the best multi-measure retrofit solution to minimize both cost and energy consumption as well as environmental emissions. 
For this purpose, we have modeled Atlanta residential buildings built over decades using the Energy Performance Calculator (EPC) building energy modeling tool and conducted sensitivity analysis to find the best possible retrofit option while changing the cost and emission restrictions. 
The preliminary results show that by decreasing the retrofit cost, the minimized delivered energy generally increased. The best cost solution is found when minimizing energy while keeping the retrofit cost lower than 30k. Results also indicated that improving the Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, windows and building insulation have the highest impacts (approximately 60%) on reducing building energy consumption. 
The result of this research can be used by policy makers and city planners to implement the best development scenarios for the Atlanta metropolitan area while improving the sustainability and energy-efficiency of the nation."

Metal organic framework (MOF) supported amine materials are novel materials that have shown promising performance for CO2 capture. In the present poster, we will consider MOF materials functionalized with amine species for CO2 capture. These adsorbents will be analyzed for a practical process, equilibrium adsorption capacity, and kinetics. Also, an approach for practical applications using structured supports will also be presented. We have created a multiscale model to analyze transport of gases in the system to enable a thorough understanding of process and economics for the system."

From a physical point of view, permeability and selectivity manipulation allows controlling the flux magnitude of certain species in a prescribed way. Although this approach has been extensively used in membrane and separation designs, the possibility of controlling flux direction to perform separations has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we show how metamaterial theory and effective medium approaches can be used to design novel anisotropic structures that can be exploited for membrane-based gas separations. The structures consist of multilayer systems made of isotropic materials in which the rationally designed anisotropic diffusion arises due to the structural arrangement of the constituent materials rather than their chemical composition. Our novel anisotropic membranes operate by directing molecules of different species toward different places in the permeate side. As a result, the separation occurs primarily as a consequence of the rerouting of mass flux in addition to differences in solubility and diffusivity. In terms of performance characterization, we have observed that selectivity in anisotropic membranes can increase by orders of magnitude in comparison with typical isotropic materials while retaining comparable permeabilities. Our work thus paves the way for the development of a new approach for the design of membrane materials and separation processes by taking advantage of an often overlooked physical property of mass flux, its directionality."
146,Muneeb,Zia,,muneeb.zia@gatech.edu,Electrical and Computer Engineering,Ph.D.,3-D Integrated Disposable Electronic Microplate Platform for Low-Cost Repeatable Biosensing Applications,"CMOS biosensors are increasingly being used for sensing electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of cellular and molecular samples for various applications including new drug development and pathogen detection. However, this technique necessitates the growth of cells onto the CMOS biosensor's surface. As the CMOS biosensor needs to undergo rigorous cleaning to avoid contamination, this makes the biosensor reuse difficult and adds additional processing time and cost. To address this challenge, this work presents a disposable e-microplate platform allowing the reuse of the CMOS biosensor and thereby reducing cost and increasing throughput relative to systems that are non-disposable. The platform utilizes mechanically-flexible interconnects (MFIs) and through-silicon-vias (TSVs) to electrically interface the sensing electrodes on the CMOS biosensor to the sensing electrodes on the e-microplate while maintaining a physical separation of the biosensors from the cellular samples. Human and mouse stem cells have been shown to successfully attach and grow on the e-microplate. The characterization results show that the e-microplate does not degrade the performance of the underlying CMOS biosensor. The average measured resistance of the TSV-MFI link is 163 mâ while the measured 3dB bandwidth and the integrated input referred noise with the e-microplate included is 0.5-400 Hz and 4.96 ÂµVrms, respectively; this ensures high SNR for sensing weak biological signals."
147,Yulian,Yao,,yyao307@gatech.edu,Materials Science and Engineering,Ph.D.,Direct Processing of PbZrxTi1-xO3 Thin Films on Glass and Polymeric Substrates,"Ferroelectric oxides are essential components in a wide spectrum of applications. In thin film form, ferroelectrics are widely used as sensors, actuators, and transducers in microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS), as well as dielectrics in multilayer ceramics capacitors, and the functional transducers in energy harvesting and pyroelectric devices. High quality ferroelectric oxide films typically require an annealing step at approximately 600 to 700 Â°C. However, full processing integration with CMOS technology required for control and memory and hence ideal device miniaturization's  necessitates processing temperatures lower than 400 â. This temperature incompatibility (and the possible chemical diffusion from oxide components within the CMOS device during the thermal treatment) has been a major challenge to integration and miniaturization of devices based on ferroelectric thin films. Furthermore, the high processing temperatures prevent direct processing of these materials on glass and polymeric substrates, the former required for smartscreen electronics and the latter for peel and stick sensors applications.
Here, we report on Xenon pulse thermal processing (PTP) approach for direct annealing of PbZrxTi1-xO3 thin films on glass and polymeric substrates. PTP uses high-density infrared plasma arc heating to deliver high intensity, uniform energy in pulse waveforms. The heating rates of PTP can be as high as 600,000 Â°C/sec, enabling a highly localized thermal energy delivery, concentrated on the surface of the sample and creating a large temperature difference between the surface and the substrate. 2-MOE-based, 0.3M PbZr0.53Ti0.47O3 (PZT) precursor solutions, with 20% excess Pb with respect to stoichiometry, were prepared in house and spun coated onto platinized glass and kapton substrate. The samples were pyrolyzed at 400 â„ƒ for 2 minutes after each deposition. 3-layered (~200 nm) and 15-layered (~1 Î¼m) thin films were prepared and an overcoat layer of PbO was spun coated to compensate for Pb loss on the surface during annealing."

Although they are known to have a collective motion around and inside food sources, a physical understanding of their high eating rates is missing. We investigate the eating behavior of larvae and their collective motion with and without food.  We show that quorum sensing is more likely to be responsible than chemotaxis for larvae detecting food. Using constant strain compression experiments, we demonstrate that these larvae exert an active pressure in addition to the elastic pressure of their bodies. We treat larvae as an active matter system and model their pressure with a mechanical theory. Additionally, we present work on improved raising techniques for these larvae."

This quality characteristic is evaluated mainly by a pair of critical points, which are corresponding to the mechanical deformations formed in the pipe connection process. However, these points are difficult to detect because of nonlinear patterns generated by latent process factors in torque signals, which conceal the true critical points. To address this problem, we propose a novel three-phase state-space model that incorporates connection physics to detect pairwise critical points. We also develop a two-stage recursive particle filter to estimate the locations of the underlying critical points. Results of a real threaded pipe connection case show that the detection performance of the proposed method is more powerful than that of other existing methods."
150,Amir,Yazdanbakhsh,,a.yazdanbakhsh@gatech.edu,Computer Science,Ph.D.,GANAX: A Unified SIMD-MIMD Acceleration for Generative Adversarial Networks,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most recent deep learning models that generate synthetic data from limited genuine datasets. GANs are on the frontier as further extension of deep learning into many domains (e.g. medicine, robotics, content synthesis) requires massive sets of labeled data that is either unavailable or is prohibitively costly to acquire. Although GANs are gaining prominence in different fields, there are no accelerators for these new models. In fact, GANs leverage a new operator, called the transposed convolution that exposes new challenges for hardware acceleration. This operator first inserts zeros within the multidimensional input and then convolves a kernel over this expanded array to add information to the embedded zeros. Even though there is a convolution stage in this operator, the inserted zeros lead to underutilization of the compute resources when a traditional convolution accelerator is used. We propose the GANAX architecture to alleviate these sources of inefficiencies, making the first GAN accelerator design possible. We propose a reordering of the output computations to allocate computing rows with similar patterns of zeros to adjacent processing engines, which also avoids inconsequential multiply-adds on the zeros. This forced adjacency reclaims data reuse across these neighboring engines, which had otherwise diminished due to the inserted zeros. This necessary reordering breaks the full SIMD execution model, which is prominent in the convolution accelerator. Therefore, we propose a MIMD-SIMD design for GANAX that leverages repeated patterns in the computation to create different microprograms that execute concurrently in SIMD mode. The interleaving of MIMD and SIMD modes is performed in the granularity of single microprogrammed operation. To amortize the cost of MIMD execution, we propose a decoupling of data accesses from data processing in GANAX. The decoupling leads to a new design that breaks each processing engine to an access micro-engine and an execute micro-engine. The proposed architecture extends the concept of access-execute architectures to the finest granularity of computation for each individual operand. Evaluations with seven GAN models shows 3.5Ã— speedup and 3.1Ã— energy savings over EYERISS without compromising the efficiency of traditional convolution. These benefits come with onlˆ7.8% area increase. These results suggest that GANAX is an effective initial step that paves the way for accelerating next generation deep models."

To deal with real-time complex road situations, automated vehicles must rely on their own sensors but also work with the sensors around them whether they are on cars (V2V) or the roads themselves, also known as V2X communications for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These devices are intended to communicate with the network in multiple bands to exchange information of various types. On the device and package levels, 5G technology has pushed the design and process engineers to investigate new methods to miniaturize and realize passive components to operate flawlessly with high efficiency and reliability in a harsh environment such as a vehicle. The objective of this research is to model, design, fabricate and characterize passive filters for 5G communication systems. Low insertion loss and high out-of-band rejection lowpass and bandpass filters are designed on thin-RDL on a glass core. Small footprint of less than twice the free-space wavelength corresponding to the operating frequency is achieved and it consequently aids in putting more adjacent band filters to address high-speed communication challenges in closely spaced frequency bands."

As these automated features are integrated into vehicles, the driver must know how to properly interact with and trust these systems.  A key element of drivers interacting and relying on these systems is the handover of control between the vehicle and driver. This handover, occurring during times of automation error, will be a critical point of high workload for drivers when driving a partially or fully automated vehicle. If the driver is aware of the system's performance and can appropriately calibrate his or her trust, then these instances of handover may become less stressful and easier to complete successfully. Prototype automation uncertainty displays have been shown to improve the handover between car and driver. Current displays however, have not focused on the information content and research based design of the displays to be given to the driver to optimize his or her understanding of the system's performance throughout the drive. The current study will explore the driving performance, trust, visual scanning behaviors, and workload for handover scenarios. Results from this study will allow system designers to better understand the relationship between the presence or absence of different types of reliability displays and driving performance, trust, and workload. Reliability displays are hypothesized to improve overall driving performance during handover situations, improve trust calibration, and improve situation awareness of the system reliability."

In turn, displacement of individuals can also promote conflict. Through challenging economic and social stability, migration of individuals creates a disruption in which host nations or regions must accommodate and support incoming individuals. I expand analysis of this feedback loop by considering a secondary cause of displacement climate change-induced disasters. Currently, individuals are being displaced at unprecedented rates due to both unstable political environments and changing climate conditions. I propose that internally displaced persons lead to distress for nations, which sometimes results in civil and external strife. Applying the gravity model from International Trade Theory, I explore this relationship between displacement and conflict. With data on internal displacement, militarized interstate disputes, and common trade control variables, I add to the existing displacement-conflict relationship literature by separately analyzing climate vs conflict-induced displacement and the respective impacts on militarized interstate disputes. I show that the direct impacts of displacement are minor to insignificant, yet contiguity and distance between nations play an important role for conflicts. This analysis is motivated with discussion on the channels of impact from displacement to conflict as well as the significance for United States national security."

Large geological structures such as salt domes, faults, and anticlines are closely associated with huge reservoirs of oil and gas. Manual delineation of such features is not only extremely time consuming but also very labor intensive. In this research, we propose seismic attributes based on texture dissimilarity, visual attention theory, and the modeling of human visual system to quantify the changes and highlight the seismic features in a three-dimensional (3D) space. This research is expected to not only become a handy tool in the interpreter's toolbox for detecting and delineating important geological structures but also reduce the time for seismic interpretation from years to months."

To affix pollen to themselves, honey bees form a suspension of pollen in nectar, creating a putty-like pollen basket that is skewered by leg hairs. We use tensile tests to show that the viscous force of the pollen basket is more than 24 times the honeybee's flight force. This work may provide inspiration for the design of robotic flying pollinators."

This will give us insights into what are aspects of technologies people use to categorize them. By understanding this, we can help influence individuals development of mental models of new technology by manipulating them based on these aspects. To gain insight into categorization, this study will use exhaustive pairwise comparisons of multiple technologies and analyze this using multi-dimensional scaling to determine how many dimensions are used to categorize technologies. The survey will be administered to participants in the United States and worldwide so we can also gain insight into any potential cross-cultural differences.

Bacteriophage - viruses that infect and lyse bacteria - have long been considered a potential approach to treat multi-drug resistant infections.  The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest and clinical trials of phage therapy in humans. However, the results of trials have been mixed.  One challenge is that successful lysis of pathogens in vitro does not account for interactions with the mammalian immune system.  Recently, the Weitz group at Georgia Tech proposed a population model that integrates the non-linear dynamics of bacteria, phage and the innate immune response.  In doing so they identified a synergistic regime in which bacteriophage and immune cells can jointly eliminate the pathogenic bacteria, even when neither phage nor the innate immune response can do so alone. We investigate this dynamic interaction between biofilms, bacteriophage and immune cells in vitro with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) as the bacterial model system.  We use high-resolution live spinning disk laser confocal microscopy to observe and quantify the spatiotemporal population dynamics of the system. Our studies provide insight into what conditions and by what mechanisms, coordinated phage and immune cell treatments of heterogeneous biofilms can suppress bacterial infection."

The system is composed of three stars: Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, stars forming an inner binary, and Proxima Centauri, an outer star that orbits around the inner binary. We computed 3-body models to follow the dynamics for the main-sequence lifetimes of the stars that are based on 100 realizations of the observed orbits. In the majority of cases, Proxima only modestly torques the A-B binary orbit, and so previous studies of planet formation and dynamics, which find the habitable zones to be stable, are somewhat justified in ignoring this effect. On the other hand, in 16% of the observationally allowed orbits, fluctuations in the orbital eccentricity of the A-B orbit destabilize the middle of the habitable zone of both stars. This result calls for further theoretical work to quantify the effect of galactic tides, passing stars, and massive planets in the triple-system dynamics."

Such events demand for increased research in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense (CBRN defense). CBRN defense relies on the ability of sensors to detect chemicals so they can be eliminated. Currently, a number of sensor can detect trace amounts of potentially harmful chemicals. However, such sensors are proximity limited which remains a universal challenge. They must be placed close to the target chemical, and detection only succeeds if the chemical is in sufficient concentrations. This is the Achilles heel of modern sensors because the location of target chemicals is often unknown. Recently a breakthrough has been made by scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They have increased the range of sensors by mimicking a dog's sniff.  We investigate an additional benefit of mimicking active sniffing by incorporating such techniques in conjunction with machine learning. In this way, we develop a new kind of biomimetic nose with enhanced sensitivity. Improving machine olfaction involves not just better sensors, but better ways to bring air to these sensors. Sniffing can bring much more information than long inhales or exposure to stagnant air, which are currently methods used for most commercial sensors. We propose a design for a novel machine for chemical detection by incorporating animal sniffing frequencies and animal nose shapes."

They have a wide variety of applications including medical ultrasounds, underwater sonars, MEMS actuation, and non-volatile memory. Relaxor-ferroelectrics are a subset of ferroelectrics that combines a relaxor and a ferroelectric in a solid solution. These material systems exhibit an exceptionally high electromechanical response at particular compositions. The origin of this high response is unknown and has been ascribed to several contributors, including submicron and micron-scale heterogeneities. Here, we report a systematic probing of the local electromechanical response in the relaxor-ferroelectric solid solution lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate for various compositions. Specifically, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) was used in band excitation (BE) mode for local characterization of the electromechanical response and relaxation processes. All measurements were performed on a 2 x 2 micron region.
     Machine learning techniques were applied to determine the fundamental behaviors and generate spatial intensity maps.  Each sample was analyzed independently to determine components and maps unique to the composition. The samples were also analyzed as a single data set to determine components present across all compositions and generate spatial intensity maps per composition. While the resulting spatial maps correlated in part with the known domain structure, areas of divergence were clearly observed. Such locations highlight non-polarization-related contributors to the response. Finally, these techniques were also applied to the hysteresis loops."

inhaling bubbles. How these mammals manipulate bubbles without losing them
is poorly understood. In this experimental study, we show that the peculiar
shape of the mole's nose can stabilize bubbles. We laser-cut a series of
star-shaped plastic templates and measure the largest angle they can be
titled before bubbles are released. The arms of the star anchor the bubbles
in place by enabling the buoyancy forces between the arms to counter the
effects of tilt. Based on this finding, we design and construct a
mole-inspired underwater sniffing device that uses oscillation of bubbles to
feed a metal oxide chemical sensor, a first step in expanding machine
olfaction to underwater applications"
162,Daniela,Hurtado,,dahl3@gatech.edu,Operations Research,Ph.D.,Tail bounds on queue lengths in data center networks and input queues switches,"In data centers, minimizing the delay is extremely important. An ideal data center network can be modeled as an nxn cross bar switch. Our objective is to find the joint distribution of queue lengths in a switch in heavy traffic. In the literature, queue lengths in heavy traffic are characterized via diffusion limits. However, this only works when the queuing system satisfies Complete Resource Pooling (CRP) in heavy traffic. The switch is the simplest non-trivial example of a network where CRP is not satisfied. It is known that heavy traffic State Space Collapse (SSC) is into a lower dimensional cone but the stationary distribution of a reflected Brownian motion there is unknown. We characterize the tail behavior of queue lengths in a switch by characterizing all the moments of the queue length. We use a drift approach, which consists in two main steps. The first is to show SSC, which is defined in terms of moments. Here we work with the original system, so the results for diffusion limits cannot be easily applied. The second step is to find a proper test function and use this notion of SSC to find lower and upper bounds which are tight in heavy traffic. We present a novel method where we use the Moment Generating Function as a test function. We start studying a single server queue modeled in discrete time. Then we generalize to a system of queues with a single arrival stream and finally to the switch system."

Air-staged combustors primarily rely upon rapid mixing and rapid combustion which occurs in a confined environment with multiple large jets carrying significant amounts of mass and momentum into a high temperature vitiated crossflow. This study focuses on elucidating the mixing and combustion processes under conditions relevant to applications in non-premixed (Rich-Quench-Lean, RQL) and premixed (Lean-Quench-Lean, LQL) staged combustors. To this effect, experimental and analytical investigations are performed in a simplified atmospheric laboratory setup using geometries, air split ratios, jet configurations and other flow parameters that are relevant to practical engine applications.
With the goal of determining mixing and flow field characteristics that are unique to highly confined multiple jets in crossflow, high speed planar and stereo PIV techniques are employed. This study examines the impact of jet-jet and jet-wall interactions on mixing for two jet configurations, namely, parallel jets and staggered-opposed jets. Moreover, high speed OH* chemiluminescence imaging of highly confined reacting jets in a high temperature, vitiated crossflow are performed to understand the controlling flame characteristics such as flame stabilization mechanisms, liftoff height and burnout distance. Reduced order chemical kinetic modeling is also used to interpret the results obtained from the flame measurements. Essentially, the temporally and spatially resolved velocity and mixing results are used together with the high speed chemiluminescence and reduced order modeling to investigate the interplay of flow and combustion characteristics in staged combustion architectures."

Human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (hHSPCs) occupy distinct niches within BM the bone marrow microenvironment under normal physiologic conditions. BM stromal cell expression of cytokines (SDF-1, SCF) and ECM (fibronectin, hyaluronic acid) maintain hHSPC phenotype and location within the BM niche. Understanding the cellular and biochemical control over HSC migration to and from the BM niche is critical to improving clinical BM transplant outcomes, which are affected by patient variability. We have developed a microfluidic, human bone marrow-on-a-chip (hBM-on-a-chip) that recreates the endosteal and perivascular niches of BM using human cells in a defined system. A five-channel polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device was designed and fabricated using standard soft lithography techniques. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were differentiated toward osteoblasts (OBs) for 21 days, after which significant matrix mineralization was observed by Alizarin Red and von Kossa staining. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were then seeded on top of the newly formed bone and vasculogenesis was observed over 5 days. Cytokines (SDF-1 and SCF) and ECM (fibronectin) expression was observed to be consistent with the native BM microenvironment. Engraftment of CD34+ HSPCs was found to be dependent on the presence of stromal cells (MSCs, OBs) in the hBM-on-a-chip."

This problem was historically debunked with human fact-checking resources (such as Politifact, Snopes and Full Fact). Human fact-checking is expensive, cumbersome and erroneous. This project aims to develop a fake news model to classify these articles, and visualize their topic spread. We developed a fake news model to classify articles, using an exhaustive set of feature extraction methods that combines techniques from the current state of art. Using NLP techniques such as word2vec, GloVE and machine learning algorithms such as SVMs and Deep Learning, we obtained an accuracy of ~ 93%. We also innovated by providing visual insight into the classification of news articles and the decision process behind it. The visualization includes an intuition behind the classification of the article by highlighting components that contributed to the classification. For example, if an article uses unusual punctuation such as multiple question marks then it will be highlighted in the article. It also includes a node map of related articles. Upon hovering on a node, a google trend chart of the keyword will be displayed, providing the user with another way of visualizing the rate at which the keyword topics are spreading."

It is crucial that people have unimpaired cognitive abilities to be fit to drive. The current standard to detect a driver's impairment is the Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST), however it only identifies impairment from alcohol. Cognition can be influenced by a range of other factors such as fatigue, drugs, brain injury, stress, or even low blood-sugar. However, there is not a test that measures cognitive readiness to perform for different types of impairment. To address this issue, the study will assess validated cognitive tests to develop a test battery that measures cognitive impairment related to driving performance. It will also investigate the relationship between validated cognitive tests and the SFST to determine the validity of the roadside sobriety test.  Participants will complete a block of cognitive tests such as the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Task, Contrast Sensitivity, and Contrast Acuity in a randomized order. They will also perform all three components of the SFST and a simulated driving task. The order of the cognitive test block, the SFST, and the driving task will be counterbalanced. To assess the relationships between the cognitive tests, the SFST, and driving performance multiple correlations will be conducted. Factor analysis will follow the correlational analysis to determine the variability among correlated variables. Upon completion, a cognitive function assessment battery will be built that measures a driver's fitness to operate a vehicle."

Lead zirconate titanate (Pb[Zr1-xTix]O3, PZT) is the primary ferroelectric in piezoelectric MEMS. However, relaxor-FE bulk single crystals, such as (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3, (1-x)PMN-xPT, exhibit even larger electromechanical responses than ceramic PZT, making PMN-PT desirable for developing next generation MEMS devices. 
Lead-based materials are radiation-hard, and studies have shown PZT's capabilities of retaining high response after radiation exposure, but still suffers from response degradation. The high chemical heterogeneity and inherent disorder of PMN-PT is expected to result in a more radiation-hard material than PZT. In this work, radiation-hardness of 0.7PMN-0.3PT and Pb[Zr0.52Ti0.48]O3 thin films to gamma irradiation is studied.
Functional measurements were conducted before and after radiation by a Â¬60Co source with ionization doses ranging from 0.2 to 10 Mrad(Si). Maximum degradation in dielectric permittivity were 4 and 10% in PMN-PT and PZT films, respectively. Maximum degradation in saturation effective longitudinal piezoelectric response of PMN-PT was 6%, and in some cases showed improvement, while in PZT was 9%. Degradation in saturated polarization in both films were negligible. PMN-PT showed overall greater radiation-hardness than PZT thin films over the studied range of radiation exposure doses. The results are expected to impact systems to be deployed in areas of high radiation exposure including those for aerospace, medical physics, x-ray/high energy source measurement tools, and continuous monitoring of nuclear power plant applications."

Here, motivated by the goal to develop an algorithm with improved gene-finding accuracy, we present a more diverse paradigm justified in part by recent experimental research.  First, we describe GeneMarkS 2,  an ab initio algorithm that utilizes a self-training derived model for finding species-specific (native) genes, along with an array of pre-computed heuristic models designed to identify harder-to-detect (likely horizontally transferred, atypical) genes. Importantly, GeneMarkS 2's self-training algorithm was designed to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) related to gene expression control; particularly patterns that are characteristic of leaderless transcription along with the more conventional RBS patterns. We assessed the accuracy of GeneMarkS 2 on test sets of genes validated by proteomics experiments, COG annotation, and N terminal protein sequencing. In comparison with current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools, we observed on average a better performance by GeneMarkS-2 in all accuracy measures. Furthermore, the screening of ~5,000 representative prokaryotic genomes revealed frequent leaderless transcription not only in archaea but also in bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in species with prevalent leadered transcription do not necessarily have the Shine-Dalgarno consensus. Therefore, the modeling of different modes of transcription and translation prompted a division of prokaryotic genomes into five groups with respect to the types of sequence patterns around their gene starts."

TMDCs have a highly anisotropic crystal structure, with edge sites and basal planes exhibiting different structural, chemical, and electronic properties. In virtually all applications, two-dimensional or bulk TMDCs must be interfaced with other materials (such as with electrical contacts in a transistor). The presence of edge sites vs. basal planes (i.e., the crystallographic orientation of the TMDC) could influence the chemical and electronic properties of these solid-state interfaces, but such effects are not well understood. Here, we use in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate how the crystallography and structure of MoS2 influence chemical transformations at solid-state interfaces with various other materials. MoS2 materials with controllably aligned crystal structures (horizontal vs. vertical orientation of basal planes) were fabricated, and in situ XPS was carried out by sputter-depositing three different materials (Li, Ge, and Ag) onto MoS2 within an XPS instrument while periodically collecting photoelectron spectra; these deposited materials are of interest due to their application in electronic devices or energy storage. The results showed that Li reacts readily with both crystallographic orientations of MoS2 to form metallic Mo and Li2S, while Ag showed very little chemical or electronic interaction with either type of MoS2. In contrast, Ge showed significant chemical interactions with MoS2 basal planes, but only minor chemical changes were observed when Ge contacted MoS2 edge sites. These findings have implications for electronic transport and band alignment at these interfaces, which is of significant interest for a variety of applications."

However, established cell sorting platforms rely on labels that are limited in number due to biophysical constraints such as overlapping emission spectra of fluorophores in FACS. Here we instead establish a framework built on a system of orthogonal and extensible DNA gates for multiplexed cell sorting. These DNA gates label target cell populations by antibodies to allow magnetic bead isolation en masse and then selectively unlock by strand displacement to sort cells. We show that DNA gated sorting (DGS) is triggered to completion within minutes on the surface of cells and achieves target cell purity, viability, and yield equivalent to that of commercial magnetic sorting kits. Using splenocytes harvested from mice, we demonstrate multiplexed sorting of three distinct immune cell populations (CD8+, CD4+, and CD19+) to high purity and show that recovered CD8+ T cells retain proliferative potential and target cell killing activity. We then extend DGS to pMHC tetramer sorting by isolating antigen-specific T cells from a mouse model of LCMV infection. Through sequence design, DGS can be expanded with fewer biophysical constraints to large families of DNA gates for applications that require analysis of complex cell populations such as host immune responses to disease."

We have found that under the slow speed considered, no sliding takes place at the belt/pulley interface, and that relative displacement between the elastomeric belt and the pulley is achieved by means of cyclic detachment. This calls into question the universal validity of the sliding-based approach to analysis of the belt drive contact. Stick-slip instabilities are observed in both the driver and driven pulleys, though the scale of these events is much larger in the first case, which renders the driver pulley as the main source of noise and vibration. The rolling contact mechanics is different in the driver and driven pulleys, which results in much different slip arc angles and calls into question the validity of the symmetric approach to analysis of the belt drive contact. Schallamach waves of detachment are observed in the driver pulley, while in the case of the driven pulley, the system instabilities result from the combination of the pulley rotation and the adhesion hysteresis."

However, while these surface designs have been shown to have various properties, an experimental verification of the very basic concept of the pulling angle effect has not yet been re-ported. To close this gap, here we use wall-shaped adhesive microstructures of three different flap heights to systematically study the effect of pulling angle on the normal and tangential components of the pull-off force tested at different prelimi-nary tangential displacements. In accord with the prediction of the Kendall model of thin-film peeling, there is an optimal attachment normal force. The optimum is obtained at about half the distance needed to initiate sliding and at pulling an-gles that range within 60o-90o, which suggests that the wall-shaped microstructure can tolerate relatively large inaccuracies in loading direction. The increase of the attachment force with increasing flap height is found to correlate with the flap thickness, which decreased with increasing flap height."

For example, strategies harnessing T cells engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) have resulted in the dramatic regression of tumors and in some patients, complete remission of metastatic disease. Yet despite such striking progress and the curative potential of engineered T cells, our ability to precisely control the cytotoxic activity of adoptively transferred T cells in vivo remains limited. This is a significant challenge as tumors have the uncanny ability to evade the immune system by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment.  Additionally, systemically administered biologics designed to hyperactivate T cells (e.g. IL-2, Î±-CTLA-4, Î±-PD1) do not discern between beneficial and deleterious T cell populations; this can lead to systemic toxicities including off-target cell killing. Here we engineer T cells that activate in response to photothermal triggers to enhance cytotoxic activity at tumor sites while reducing off-target effects.  We leverage tumor-localized gold nanorods to locally generate heat in response to incident near infrared light.  This heat then triggers tumor-infiltrated T cells to express genetically engineered IL-2 under the control of heat shock promoters thereby controlling T cell proliferation and activation.  This platform may increase the precision of engineered T cell therapies for cancer."

They are called zero-rated services because the data usage costs of those applications is zero. Facebook has partnered with mobile service providers in multiple countries to launch its zero-rated service: Free Basics. Free Basics is a platform which hosts not only Facebook, but other select websites which are zero-rated as well.

The research attempts to answer the question: are you better off paying nothing for a limited part of the Internet, or paying for the open Internet?

The question will be analyzed using three distinct datasets: user level surveys, mobile service provider data and data from telecom regulators regarding usage. Free Basics has been implemented in 60 countries, most of them emerging economies. This research will focus on 7 African countries which have had Free Basics for more than 2 years. Preliminary results have shown that there are migration patterns that can be discerned. One is individuals who go from not having the Internet to using Free Basics. The next is from Free Basics to the open Internet. The third, is individuals who do not find Free Basics useful, and go back off the grid. 

It can be hypothesized that there is a bracket of socio-economic conditions where an individual is better off with Free Basics than paying for the open Internet. Using a regression model with derived utility from Internet access as the dependent variable, this research will attempt to find that bracket."

In this paper, we consider the problem of online monitoring a class of big data streams where each data stream is associated with a spatial location. Our goal is to quickly detect shifts occurred in such big data streams when only partial information can be observed at each time, and the out-of-control variables are clustered in a small and unknown region. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel Spatial Adaptive Sampling and Monitoring (SASAM) procedure that aims to leverage the spatial information of the data streams for quick change detection. Specifically, the proposed sampling strategy will adaptively and intelligently integrate two seemingly contradictory ideas: (1) random sampling that quickly searches for possible out-of-control variables; and (2) directional sampling that focuses on highly suspicious out-of-control variables that may cluster in a small region. Simulation and real example studies show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing sampling strategy without taking the spatial information of the data streams into consideration."

While the transition to an anisotropic state has been studied it is yet to be determined if an additional alignment agent could induce the characteristic anisotropy below the transition concentration and what would remain after disassembling this alignment network.  In this work the use of arborol thermoreversible gel systems are used with aqueous liquid crystals such as cellulose nanocrystals to study this phenomena.  Due to their thermoreversible gel properties, arborols make a perfect candidate for studying these networks.  In addition to their use in liquid crystal network alignment, arborols will also be used in elucidating the structure of other aqueous gel networks."
